https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02328,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02328,Disrupting Test Development with AI Assistants,"Vijay Joshi, Iver Band","Recent advancements in largelanguagemodels, including GPT-4 and its variants, and Generative AI-assisted coding tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Tabnine, have significantly transformed software development. This paper analyzes how these innovations impact productivity and softwaretest development metrics. These tools enable developers to generate complete software programs with minimal human intervention before deployment. However, thorough review and testing by developers are still crucial. Utilizing the Test Pyramid concept, which categorizes tests into unit, integration, and end-to-endtests, we evaluate three popular AI coding assistants by generating and comparing unit tests for opensource modules. Our findings show that AI-generated tests are of equivalent quality to original tests, highlighting differences in usage and results among the tools. This research enhances the understanding and capabilities of AI-assistant tools in automated testing.","Submitted 4 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024."
