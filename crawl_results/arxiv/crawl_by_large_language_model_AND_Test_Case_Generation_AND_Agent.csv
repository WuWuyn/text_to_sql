The object of this research is the Quality Assurance processes for modern distributed software applications. The subject of the research is the assessment of the benefits, challenges, and prospects of integrating modern AI-oriented tools into quality assurance processes. We performed comprehensive analysis of implications on both verification and validation processes covering exploratory test analyses, equivalence partitioning and boundary analyses, metamorphic testing, finding inconsistencies in acceptance criteria (AC), static analyses, testcasegeneration, unit test generation, test suit optimization and assessment, end to end scenario execution. End to end regression of sample enterprise application utilizing AI-agents over generated test scenarios was implemented as a proof of concept highlighting practical use of the study. The results, with only 8.3% flaky executions of generated test cases, indicate significant potential for the proposed approaches. However, the study also identified substantial challenges for practical adoption concerning generation of semantically identical coverage, ""black box"" nature and lack of explainability from state-of-the-art LargeLanguageModels (LLMs), the tendency to correct mutated test cases to match expected results, underscoring the necessity for thorough verification of both generated artifacts and test execution results. The research demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the importance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies, considering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate verification methodologies.","Submitted 19 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09289,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09289,UTBoost: Rigorous Evaluation of Coding Agents on SWE-Bench,"Boxi Yu, Yuxuan Zhu, Pinjia He, Daniel Kang","The advent of LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) has spurred the development of coding agents for real-world code generation. As a widely used benchmark for evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce UTGenerator, an LLM-driven testcasegenerator that automatically analyzes codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections, impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard entries, yield 18 and 11 ranking changes, respectively.","Submitted 10 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

However, while a large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions, is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain. Therefore, testcasegeneration is a necessary task for building large-scale datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR). Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages for RL.","Submitted 6 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

As a complementary aspect to code generation, testcasegeneration is of crucial importance in ensuring the quality and reliability of code. However, using LLMs as testcasegenerators has been much less explored. Current research along this line primarily focuses on enhancing code generation with assistance from testcasesgenerated by LLMs, while the performance of LLMs in testcasegeneration alone has not been comprehensively examined. To bridge this gap, we conduct extensive experiments to study how well LLMs can generate high-quality test cases. We find that as the problem difficulty increases, state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to generate correct test cases, largely due to their inherent limitations in computation and reasoning. To mitigate this issue, we further propose a multi-agent framework called \emph{TestChain} that decouples the generation of test inputs and test outputs. Notably, TestChain uses a ReAct format conversation chain for LLMs to interact with a Python interpreter in order to provide more accurate test outputs. Our results indicate that TestChain outperforms the baseline by a large margin. Particularly, in terms of the accuracy of test cases, TestChain using GPT-4 as the backbone achieves a 13.84\% improvement over the baseline on the LeetCode-hard dataset.","Submitted 20 April, 2024; originally announced April 2024."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13010,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13010,AgentCoder: Multi-Agent-based Code Generation with Iterative Testing and Optimisation,"Dong Huang, Jie M. Zhang, Michael Luck, Qingwen Bu, Yuhao Qing, Heming Cui","The advancement of natural language processing (NLP) has been significantly boosted by the development of transformer-based largelanguagemodels (LLMs). These models have revolutionized NLP tasks, particularly in code generation, aiding developers in creating software with enhanced efficiency. Despite their advancements, challenges in balancing code snippet generation with effective testcasegeneration and execution persist. To address these issues, this paper introduces Multi-Agent Assistant Code Generation (AgentCoder), a novel solution comprising a multi-agent framework with specialized agents: the programmer agent, the test designer agent, and the test executor agent. During the coding procedure, the programmer agent will focus on the code generation and refinement based on the test executor agent's feedback. The test designer agent will generate test cases for the generated code, and the test executor agent will run the code with the test cases and write the feedback to the programmer. This collaborative system ensures robust code generation, surpassing the limitations of single-agent models and traditional methodologies. Our extensive experiments on 9 code generation models and 12 enhancement approaches showcase AgentCoder's superior performance over existing code generation models and prompt engineering techniques across various benchmarks. For example, AgentCoder (GPT-4) achieves 96.3\% and 91.8\% pass@1 in HumanEval and MBPP datasets with an overall token overhead of 56.9K and 66.3K, while state-of-the-art obtains only 90.2\% and 78.9\% pass@1 with an overall token overhead of 138.2K and 206.5K.","Submitted 24 May, 2024; v1 submitted 20 December, 2023; originally announced December 2023."
