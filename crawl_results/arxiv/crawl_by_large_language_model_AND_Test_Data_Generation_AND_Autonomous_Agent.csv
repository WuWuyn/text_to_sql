https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16197,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16197,LASER: Script Execution by AutonomousAgents for On-demand Traffic Simulation,"Hao Gao, Jingyue Wang, Wenyang Fang, Jingwei Xu, Yunpeng Huang, Taolue Chen, Xiaoxing Ma","Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) require diverse and safety-critical traffic scenarios for effective training and testing, but the existing data generation methods struggle to provide flexibility and scalability. We propose LASER, a novel frame-work that leverage largelanguagemodels (LLMs) to conduct traffic simulations based on natural language inputs. The framework operates in two stages: it first generates scripts from user-provided descriptions and then executes them using autonomousagents in real time. Validated in the CARLA simulator, LASER successfully generates complex, on-demand driving scenarios, significantly improving ADS training and testingdatageneration.","Submitted 24 October, 2024; v1 submitted 21 October, 2024; originally announced October 2024."
