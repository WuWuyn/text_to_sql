https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14336,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14336,Toward Generation of Test Cases from Task Descriptions via History-aware Planning,"Duy Cao, Phu Nguyen, Vy Le, Tien N. Nguyen, Vu Nguyen","In automated webtesting, generating test scripts from natural language task descriptions is crucial for enhancing the test generation process. This activity involves creating the correct sequences of actions to form test scripts for future testing activities. Current state-of-the-art approaches are limited in generating these action sequences, as they either demand substantial manual effort for human demonstrations or fail to consider the history of previous web content and actions to decide the next action. In this paper, we introduce HxAgent, an iterative largelanguagemodel agent planning approach that determines the next action based on: 1) observations of the current contents and feasible actions, 2) short-term memory of previous web states and actions, and 3) long-term experience with (in)correct action sequences. The agent generates a sequence of actions to perform a given task, which is effectively an automated test case to verify the task. We conducted an extensive empirical evaluation of HxAgent using two datasets. On the MiniWoB++ dataset, our approach achieves 97% exact-match accuracy that is comparable to the best baselines while eliminating the need for human demonstrations required by those methods. For complex tasks requiring navigation through multiple actions and screens, HxAgent achieves an average 82% exact-match. On the second dataset, comprising 350 task instances across seven popular websites, including YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google, HxAgent achieves high performance, with 87% of the action sequences exactly matching the ground truth and a prefix-match of 93%, outperforming the baseline by 59%.","Submitted 19 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10741,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10741,NaviQAte: Functionality-Guided Web Application Navigation,"Mobina Shahbandeh, Parsa Alian, Noor Nashid, Ali Mesbah","End-to-end webtesting is challenging due to the need to explore diverse web application functionalities. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as WebCanvas, are not designed for broad functionality exploration; they rely on specific, detailed task descriptions, limiting their adaptability in dynamic web environments. We introduce NaviQAte, which frames web application exploration as a question-and-answer task, generating action sequences for functionalities without requiring detailed parameters. Our three-phase approach utilizes advanced largelanguagemodels like GPT-4o for complex decision-making and cost-effective models, such as GPT-4o mini, for simpler tasks. NaviQAte focuses on functionality-guided web application navigation, integrating multi-modal inputs such as text and images to enhance contextual understanding. Evaluations on the Mind2Web-Live and Mind2Web-Live-Abstracted datasets show that NaviQAte achieves a 44.23% success rate in user task navigation and a 38.46% success rate in functionality navigation, representing a 15% and 33% improvement over WebCanvas. These results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in advancing automated web application testing.","Submitted 16 September, 2024; originally announced September 2024."
