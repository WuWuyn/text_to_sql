https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01866,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01866,From Code Generation to SoftwareTesting: AI Copilot with Context-Based RAG,"Yuchen Wang, Shangxin Guo, Chee Wei Tan","The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands on traditional testing methodologies, often leading to bottlenecks in efficiency, accuracy, and coverage. We propose a novel perspective on softwaretesting by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two interconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with limited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming, which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of softwaretesting. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based RetrievalAugmentedGeneration (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug detection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5% higher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.","Submitted 5 April, 2025; v1 submitted 2 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14000,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14000,LLM-based Unit Test Generation for Dynamically-Typed Programs,"Runlin Liu, Zhe Zhang, Yunge Hu, Yuhang Lin, Xiang Gao, Hailong Sun","Automated unit test generation has been widely studied, but generating effective tests for dynamically typed programs remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches, including search-based softwaretesting (SBST) and recent LLM-based methods, often suffer from type errors, leading to invalid inputs and assertion failures, ultimately reducing testing effectiveness. To address this, we propose TypeTest, a novel framework that enhances type correctness in test generation through a vector-based Retrieval-AugmentedGeneration (RAG) system. TypeTest employs call instance retrieval and feature-based retrieval to infer parameter types accurately and construct valid test inputs. Furthermore, it utilizes the call graph to extract richer contextual information, enabling more accurate assertion generation. In addition, TypeTest incorporates a repair mechanism and iterative test generation, progressively refining test cases to improve coverage. In an evaluation on 125 real-world Python modules, TypeTest achieved an average statement coverage of 86.6% and branch coverage of 76.8%, outperforming state-of-theart tools by 5.4% and 9.3%, respectively.","Submitted 18 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20812,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20812,Towards Reliable Vector Database Management Systems: A SoftwareTesting Roadmap for 2030,"Shenao Wang, Yanjie Zhao, Yinglin Xie, Zhao Liu, Xinyi Hou, Quanchen Zou, Haoyu Wang","The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-driven applications has propelled Vector Database Management Systems (VDBMSs) into the spotlight as a critical infrastructure component. VDBMS specializes in storing, indexing, and querying dense vector embeddings, enabling advanced LLM capabilities such as retrieval-augmentedgeneration, long-term memory, and caching mechanisms. However, the explosive adoption of VDBMS has outpaced the development of rigorous softwaretesting methodologies tailored for these emerging systems. Unlike traditional databases optimized for structured data, VDBMS face unique testing challenges stemming from the high-dimensional nature of vector data, the fuzzy semantics in vector search, and the need to support dynamic data scaling and hybrid query processing. In this paper, we begin by conducting an empirical study of VDBMS defects and identify key challenges in test input generation, oracle definition, and test evaluation. Drawing from these insights, we propose the first comprehensive research roadmap for developing effective testing methodologies tailored to VDBMS. By addressing these challenges, the softwaretesting community can contribute to the development of more reliable and trustworthy VDBMS, enabling the full potential of LLMs and data-intensive AI applications.","Submitted 28 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."
