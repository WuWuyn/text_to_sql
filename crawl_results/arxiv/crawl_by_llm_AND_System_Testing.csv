Briand, Ruiyuan Wan, Ruifeng Gao","Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex systemtest code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for systemtest code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex systemtest code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).","Submitted 23 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

For applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents. However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification and combined application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system. The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering, server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.","Submitted 16 June, 2025; v1 submitted 12 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

Despite its importance, executing the test suite of a project can be challenging in practice because different projects use different programming languages, software ecosystems, build systems, testing frameworks, and other tools. These challenges make it difficult to create a reliable, universal test execution method that works across different projects. This paper presents ExecutionAgent, an automated technique that prepares scripts for building an arbitrary project from source code and running its test cases. Inspired by the way a human developer would address this task, our approach is a large language model (LLM)-based agent that autonomously executes commands and interacts with the host system. The agent uses meta-prompting to gather guidelines on the latest technologies related to the given project, and it iteratively refines its process based on feedback from the previous steps. Our evaluation applies ExecutionAgent to 50 open-source projects that use 14 different programming languages and many different build and testing tools. The approach successfully executes the test suites of 33/50 projects, while matching the test results of ground truth test suite executions with a deviation of only 7.5%. These results improve over the best previously available technique by 6.6x. The costs imposed by the approach are reasonable, with an execution time of 74 minutes and LLM costs of USD 0.16, on average per project. We envision ExecutionAgent to serve as a valuable tool for developers, automated programming tools, and researchers that need to execute tests across a wide variety of projects.","Submitted 30 April, 2025; v1 submitted 13 December, 2024; originally announced December 2024."

Creating comprehensive test cases for systemtesting from requirements is often challenging and time-consuming. This paper explores the effectiveness of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate test case designs from Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents. In this study, we collected the SRS documents of five software engineering projects containing functional and non-functional requirements, which were implemented, tested, and delivered by respective developer teams. For generating test case designs, we used ChatGPT-4o Turbo model. We employed prompt-chaining, starting with an initial context-setting prompt, followed by prompts to generate test cases for each use case. We assessed the quality of the generated test case designs through feedback from the same developer teams as mentioned above. Our experiments show that about 87 percent of the generated test cases were valid, with the remaining 13 percent either not applicable or redundant. Notably, 15 percent of the valid test cases were previously not considered by developers in their testing. We also tasked ChatGPT with identifying redundant test cases, which were subsequently validated by the respective developers to identify false positives and to uncover any redundant test cases that may have been missed by the developers themselves. This study highlights the potential of leveraging LLMs for test generation from the Requirements Specification document and also for assisting developers in quickly identifying and addressing redundancies, ultimately improving test suite quality and efficiency of the testing procedure.","Submitted 4 December, 2024; originally announced December 2024."

Oliva, Dayi Lin, Ahmed E. Hassan","The rapid expansion of foundation models (FMs), such as large language models (LLMs), has given rise to FMware--software systems that integrate FMs as core components. While building demonstration-level FMware is relatively straightforward, transitioning to production-ready systems presents numerous challenges, including reliability, high implementation costs, scalability, and compliance with privacy regulations. Our paper conducts a semi-structured thematic synthesis to identify the key challenges in productionizing FMware across diverse data sources including our own industry experience in developing FMArts--a FMware lifecycle engineering platform and integrating it into Huawei cloud, grey literature, academic publications, hands-on involvement in the Open Platform for Enterprise AI (OPEA), organizing the AIware conference and Bootcamp, and co-leading the ISO SPDX SBOM working group on AI and datasets. We identify critical issues in FM selection, data and model alignment, prompt engineering, agent orchestration, systemtesting, and deployment, alongside cross-cutting concerns such as memory management, observability, and feedback integration. We discuss needed technologies and strategies to address these challenges and offer guidance on how to enable the transition from demonstration systems to scalable, production-ready FMware solutions. Our findings underscore the importance of continued research and multi-industry collaboration to advance the development of production-ready FMware.","Submitted 27 January, 2025; v1 submitted 28 October, 2024; originally announced October 2024."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01397,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01397,LTM: Scalable and Black-box Similarity-based Test Suite Minimization based on Language Models,"Rongqi Pan, Taher A. Ghaleb, Lionel Briand","Test suites tend to grow when software evolves, making it often infeasible to execute all test cases with the allocated testing budgets, especially for large software systems. Test suite minimization (TSM) is employed to improve the efficiency of software testing by removing redundant test cases, thus reducing testing time and resources, while maintaining the fault detection capability of the test suite. Most existing TSM approaches rely on code coverage (white-box) or model-based features, which are not always available to test engineers. Recent TSM approaches that rely only on test code (black-box) have been proposed, such as ATM and FAST-R. To address the scalability, we propose LTM (Language model-based Test suite Minimization), a novel, scalable, and black-box similarity-based TSM approach based on large language models (LLMs), which is the first application of LLMs in the context of TSM. To support similarity measurement for test code embeddings, we investigate five pre-trained language models: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXcoder, StarEncoder, and CodeLlama, on which we compute two similarity measures: Cosine Similarity and Euclidean Distance. Our goal is to find similarity measures that are not only computationally more efficient but can also better guide a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search for optimal minimized test suites, thus reducing the overall search time. Experimental results show that the best configuration of LTM (UniXcoder/Cosine) outperforms ATM in three aspects: (a) achieving a slightly greater saving rate of testing time (41.72% versus 41.02%, on average); (b) attaining a significantly higher fault detection rate (0.84 versus 0.81, on average); and, most importantly, (c) minimizing test suites nearly five times faster on average, with higher gains for larger test suites and systems, thus achieving much higher scalability.","Submitted 30 September, 2024; v1 submitted 3 April, 2023; originally announced April 2023."
