A system titled XUAT has been developed for this purpose. However, there is still a human-labor-intensive stage, i.e, testscriptsgeneration, in the current system. Therefore, in this paper, we concentrate on methods of boosting the automation level of the current system, particularly the stage of testscriptsgeneration. With recent notable successes, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in attaining human-like intelligence and there has been a growing research area that employs LLMs as autonomous agents to obtain human-like decision-making capabilities. Inspired by these works, we propose an LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative system, named XUAT-Copilot, for automated UAT. The proposed system mainly consists of three LLM-based agents responsible for action planning, state checking and parameter selecting, respectively, and two additional modules for state sensing and case rewriting. The agents interact with testing device, make human-like decision and generate action command in a collaborative way. The proposed multi-agent system achieves a close effectiveness to human testers in our experimental studies and gains a significant improvement of Pass@1 accuracy compared with single-agent architecture. More importantly, the proposed system has launched in the formal testing environment of WeChat Pay mobile app, which saves a considerable amount of manpower in the daily development work.","Submitted 10 January, 2024; v1 submitted 5 January, 2024; originally announced January 2024."
