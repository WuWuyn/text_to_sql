The object of this research is the Quality Assurance processes for modern distributed software applications. The subject of the research is the assessment of the benefits, challenges, and prospects of integrating modern AI-oriented tools into quality assurance processes. We performed comprehensive analysis of implications on both verification and validation processes covering exploratory test analyses, equivalence partitioning and boundary analyses, metamorphic testing, finding inconsistencies in acceptance criteria (AC), static analyses, test case generation, unit test generation, test suit optimization and assessment, end to end scenario execution. End to end regression of sample enterprise application utilizing AI-agents over generated test scenarios was implemented as a proof of concept highlighting practical use of the study. The results, with only 8.3% flaky executions of generated test cases, indicate significant potential for the proposed approaches. However, the study also identified substantial challenges for practical adoption concerning generation of semantically identical coverage, ""black box"" nature and lack of explainability from state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), the tendency to correct mutated test cases to match expected results, underscoring the necessity for thorough verification of both generated artifacts and test execution results. The research demonstrates AI's transformative potential for QA but highlights the importance of a strategic approach to implementing these technologies, considering the identified limitations and the need for developing appropriate verification methodologies.","Submitted 19 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification, leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AIagents.","Submitted 12 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

These behaviors are not solely the product of the internal architectures of the underlying models, but emerge from their integration into agentic systems operating within specific contexts, where environmental factors, social cues, and interaction feedbacks shape behavior over time. This evolution necessitates a new scientific perspective: AIAgent Behavioral Science. Rather than focusing only on internal mechanisms, this perspective emphasizes the systematic observation of behavior, design of interventions to test hypotheses, and theory-guided interpretation of how AIagents act, adapt, and interact over time. We systematize a growing body of research across individual agent, multi-agent, and human-agent interaction settings, and further demonstrate how this perspective informs responsible AI by treating fairness, safety, interpretability, accountability, and privacy as behavioral properties. By unifying recent findings and laying out future directions, we position AIAgent Behavioral Science as a necessary complement to traditional model-centric approaches, providing essential tools for understanding, evaluating, and governing the real-world behavior of increasingly autonomous AI systems.","Submitted 12 June, 2025; v1 submitted 4 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

This shift from static, single-turn inference to agentic, multi-turn workflows broadens task generalization and behavioral flexibility, but it also introduces serious concerns about system-level cost, efficiency, and sustainability. This paper presents the first comprehensive system-level analysis of AIagents, quantifying their resource usage, latency behavior, energy consumption, and datacenter-wide power consumption demands across diverse agent designs and test-time scaling strategies. We further characterize how AIagent design choices, such as few-shot prompting, reflection depth, and parallel reasoning, impact accuracy-cost tradeoffs. Our findings reveal that while agents improve accuracy with increased compute, they suffer from rapidly diminishing returns, widening latency variance, and unsustainable infrastructure costs. Through detailed evaluation of representative agents, we highlight the profound computational demands introduced by AIagent workflows, uncovering a looming sustainability crisis. These results call for a paradigm shift in agent design toward compute-efficient reasoning, balancing performance with deployability under real-world constraints.","Submitted 4 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

The simulator provides a realistic approach to patient presentation and multi-turn conversation with a symptom-checking agent. Objectives: (1) To construct and instantiate a Patient Simulator to train and test an AI health agent, based on patient vignettes derived from real EHR data. (2) To test the validity and alignment of the simulated encounters provided by the Patient Simulator to expert human clinical providers. (3) To illustrate the evaluation framework of such an LLM system on the generated realistic, data-driven simulations -- yielding a preliminary assessment of our proposed system. Methods: We first constructed realistic clinical scenarios by deriving patient vignettes from real-world EHR encounters. These vignettes cover a variety of presenting symptoms and underlying conditions. We then evaluate the performance of the Patient Simulator as a simulacrum of a real patient encounter across over 500 different patient vignettes. We leveraged a separate AIagent to provide multi-turn questions to obtain a history of present illness. The resulting multiturn conversations were evaluated by two expert clinicians. Results: Clinicians scored the Patient Simulator as consistent with the patient vignettes in those same 97.7% of cases. The extracted case summary based on the conversation history was 99% relevant. Conclusions: We developed a methodology to incorporate vignettes derived from real healthcare patient data to build a simulation of patient responses to symptom checking agents. The performance and alignment of this Patient Simulator could be used to train and test a multi-turn conversational AIagent at scale.","Submitted 4 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

The practice of red-teaming for LLMs is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of red-teaming principles as instructions to an AIagent to automatically orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts. Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.","Submitted 31 May, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

Despite substantial progress in deep learning, state-of-the-art models still achieve accuracy rates of merely 40-55% on 2024 ARC Competition, indicative of a significant gap between their performance and human-level reasoning. In this work, we seek to bridge that gap by introducing an analogy-inspired ARC dataset, GIFARC. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), we synthesize new ARC-style tasks from a variety of GIF images that include analogies. Each new task is paired with ground-truth analogy, providing an explicit mapping between visual transformations and everyday concepts. By embedding robust human-intuitive analogies into ARC-style tasks, GIFARC guides AIagents to evaluate the task analogically before engaging in brute-force pattern search, thus efficiently reducing problem complexity and build a more concise and human-understandable solution. We empirically validate that guiding LLM with analogic approach with GIFARC affects task-solving approaches of LLMs to align with analogic approach of human.","Submitted 26 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Recent advances in AI achieve human-like performance in tasks integrating multimodal information, particularly in large language models, raising interest in the embodiment capabilities of AIagents on nonhuman platforms such as robots. Here, we explore whether multimodal LLMs can develop self-awareness solely through sensorimotor experiences. By integrating a multimodal LLM into an autonomous mobile robot, we test its ability to achieve this capacity. We find that the system exhibits robust environmental awareness, self-recognition and predictive awareness, allowing it to infer its robotic nature and motion characteristics. Structural equation modeling reveals how sensory integration influences distinct dimensions of self-awareness and its coordination with past-present memory, as well as the hierarchical internal associations that drive self-identification. Ablation tests of sensory inputs identify critical modalities for each dimension, demonstrate compensatory interactions among sensors and confirm the essential role of structured and episodic memory in coherent reasoning. These findings demonstrate that, given appropriate sensory information about the world and itself, multimodal LLMs exhibit emergent self-awareness, opening the door to artificial embodied cognitive systems.","Submitted 25 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

MacLellan","Recent improvements in large language model (LLM) performance on academic benchmarks, such as MATH and GSM8K, have emboldened their use as standalone tutors and as simulations of human learning. However, these new applications require more than evaluations of final solution generation. We introduce TutorGym to evaluate these applications more directly. TutorGym is a standard interface for testing artificial intelligence (AI) agents within existing intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that have been tested and refined in classroom studies, including Cognitive Tutors (CTAT), Apprentice Tutors, and OATutors. TutorGym is more than a simple problem-solution benchmark, it situates AIagents within the interactive interfaces of existing ITSs. At each step of problem-solving, AIagents are asked what they would do as a tutor or as a learner. As tutors, AIagents are prompted to provide tutoring support -- such as generating examples, hints, and step-level correctness feedback -- which can be evaluated directly against the adaptive step-by-step support provided by existing ITSs. As students, agents directly learn from ITS instruction, and their mistakes and learning trajectories can be compared to student data. TutorGym establishes a common framework for training and evaluating diverse AIagents, including LLMs, computational models of learning, and reinforcement learning agents, within a growing suite of learning environments. Currently, TutorGym includes 223 different tutor domains. In an initial evaluation, we find that current LLMs are poor at tutoring -- none did better than chance at labeling incorrect actions, and next-step actions were correct only ~52-70% of the time -- but they could produce remarkably human-like learning curves when trained as students with in-context learning.","Submitted 2 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

DoomArena is designed on three principles: 1) It is a plug-in framework and integrates easily into realistic agentic frameworks like BrowserGym (for web agents) and τ

We illustrate several advantages of our framework, including the ability to adapt to new threat models and environments easily, the ability to easily combine several previously published attacks to enable comprehensive and fine-grained security testing, and the ability to analyze trade-offs between various vulnerabilities and performance. We apply DoomArena to state-of-the-art (SOTA) web and tool-calling agents and find a number of surprising results: 1) SOTA agents have varying levels of vulnerability to different threat models (malicious user vs malicious environment), and there is no Pareto dominant agent across all threat models; 2) When multiple attacks are applied to an agent, they often combine constructively; 3) Guardrail model-based defenses seem to fail, while defenses based on powerful SOTA LLMs work better.

This study proposes and tests methods for probing, quantifying, and modifying an LLM's internal representations in a Dictator Game -- a classic behavioral experiment on fairness and prosocial behavior. We extract ``vectors of variable variations'' (e.g., ``male'' to ``female'') from the LLM's internal state. Manipulating these vectors during the model's inference can substantially alter how those variables relate to the model's decision-making.

By embedding Large Language Model (LLM) agents within an evolutionary game-theoretic framework, this paper investigates the complex interplay between AI developers, regulators and users, modelling their strategic choices under different regulatory scenarios. Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is used to quantitatively model the dilemmas faced by each actor, and LLMs provide additional degrees of complexity and nuances and enable repeated games and incorporation of personality traits. Our research identifies emerging behaviours of strategic AIagents, which tend to adopt more ""pessimistic"" (not trusting and defective) stances than pure game-theoretic agents. We observe that, in case of full trust by users, incentives are effective to promote effective regulation; however, conditional trust may deteriorate the ""social pact"". Establishing a virtuous feedback between users' trust and regulators' reputation thus appears to be key to nudge developers towards creating safe AI. However, the level at which this trust emerges may depend on the specific LLM used for testing.

Research has explored their role within development teams, focusing on specific tasks such as artifact generation, decision-making support, and information retrieval. Despite the growing body of work on LLMs in software engineering, most studies have centered on broad adoption trends, neglecting the nuanced relationship between individual cognitive and behavioral factors and their impact on task-specific adoption. While factors such as perceived effort and performance expectancy have been explored at a general level, their influence on distinct software engineering tasks remains underexamined. This gap hinders the development of tailored LLM-based systems (e.g., Generative AIAgents) that align with engineers' specific needs and limits the ability of team leaders to devise effective strategies for fostering LLM adoption in targeted workflows. This study bridges this gap by surveying N=188 software engineers to test the relationship between individual attributes related to technology adoption and LLM adoption across five key tasks, using structural equation modeling (SEM). The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was applied to characterize individual adoption behaviors. The findings reveal that task-specific adoption is influenced by distinct factors, some of which negatively impact adoption when considered in isolation, underscoring the complexity of LLM integration in software engineering.

This technological advancement raises fundamental questions about AI's impact on the diversity and democratic value of information ecosystems. We introduce a large-scale simulation framework to examine AI-based imitation within news, a context crucial for public discourse. By systematically testing two distinct imitation strategies across a range of information environments varying in initial diversity, we demonstrate that AI-generated articles do not uniformly homogenize content. Instead, AI's influence is strongly context-dependent: AI-generated content can introduce valuable diversity in originally homogeneous news environments but diminish diversity in initially heterogeneous contexts. These results illustrate that the initial diversity of an information environment critically shapes AI's impact, challenging assumptions that AI-driven imitation threatens diversity. Instead, when information is initially homogeneous, AI-driven imitation can expand perspectives, styles, and topics. This is especially important in news contexts, where information diversity fosters richer public debate by exposing citizens to alternative viewpoints, challenging biases, and preventing narrative monopolies, which is essential for a resilient democracy.","Submitted 28 March, 2025; v1 submitted 20 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025."

This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AIagents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming.

However, many scenarios require the agents to exhibit stronger social and conversational intelligence and demonstrate more human-like (anthropomorphic) reactions. This is an aspect that foundational LLMs have yet to fully address such that a single call of foundational models might be insufficient. To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage solution. In this work, we focus on the first stage, introducing a multi-module framework designed to replicate the key aspects of human intelligence involved in conversations. This framework comprises thinking modules for reasoning, resource modules for managing knowledge and external information, and response modules for generating contextually appropriate interactions. With all the modules cooperating, the framework would empower the agents to provide a better human-like conversation experience. In the second stage of our approach, these conversational data, after filtering and labeling, can serve as training and testing data for reinforcement learning, enabling AI to better capture human preferences. This stage is left for future work. In our experiments, volunteers engaged in over 3000 rounds of conversation with the same AI character powered by a standalone LLM and our framework which integrates the same LLM. A separate group of evaluators rated the conversation samples, revealing that our framework significantly enhanced the social and conversational intelligence, even without fine-tuning the LLM.","Submitted 27 February, 2025; originally announced March 2025."

To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs. As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical. However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy. Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language. Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents. To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations. ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses. ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate. Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment. We find that many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification. Specifically, we show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable AIagents.","Submitted 11 March, 2025; v1 submitted 6 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025."

This work presents an AI-driven telephone survey system integrating text-to-speech (TTS), a large language model (LLM), and speech-to-text (STT) that mimics the versatility of human-led interviews (full-duplex dialogues) at scale. We tested the system across two populations, a pilot study in the United States (n = 75) and a large-scale deployment in Peru (n = 2,739), inviting participants via web-based links and contacting them via direct phone calls. The AIagent successfully administered open-ended and closed-ended questions, handled basic clarifications, and dynamically navigated branching logic, allowing fast large-scale survey deployment without interviewer recruitment or training. Our findings demonstrate that while the AI system's probing for qualitative depth was more limited than human interviewers, overall data quality approached human-led standards for structured items. This study represents one of the first successful large-scale deployments of an LLM-based telephone interviewer in a real-world survey context.

Considering the many-shot jailbreaking and deceptive alignment as some of the main advanced attacks, that cannot be mitigated by the static guardrails used during the supervised training, points out a crucial research priority for real world robustness. The combination of static guardrails in dynamic multi-agent system fails to defend against those attacks. We intend to enhance security for LLM-based agents through the development of new evaluation frameworks which identify and counter threats for safe operational deployment. Our work uses three examination methods to detect rogue agents through a Reverse Turing Test and analyze deceptive alignment through multi-agent simulations and develops an anti-jailbreaking system by testing it with GEMINI 1.5 pro and llama-3.3-70B, deepseek r1 models using tool-mediated adversarial scenarios. The detection capabilities are strong such as 94\% accuracy for GEMINI 1.5 pro yet the system suffers persistent vulnerabilities when under long attacks as prompt length increases attack success rates (ASR) and diversity metrics become ineffective in prediction while revealing multiple complex system faults. The findings demonstrate the necessity of adopting flexible security systems based on active monitoring that can be performed by the agents themselves together with adaptable interventions by system admin as the current models can create vulnerabilities that can lead to the unreliable and vulnerable system.

Effective collaboration in shared environments requires participants -- whether humans or AIagents -- to stay on the same page as their environment evolves. When a collaborator's understanding diverges from the current state -- what we term the out-of-sync challenge -- the collaborator's actions may fail, leading to integration issues. In this work, we introduce SyncMind, a framework that systematically defines the out-of-sync problem faced by large language model (LLM) agents in collaborative software engineering (CSE). Based on SyncMind, we create SyncBench, a benchmark featuring 24,332 instances of agent out-of-sync scenarios in real-world CSE derived from 21 popular GitHub repositories with executable verification tests. Experiments on SyncBench uncover critical insights into existing LLM agents' capabilities and limitations. Besides substantial performance gaps among agents (from Llama-3.1 agent <= 3.33% to Claude-3.5-Sonnet >= 28.18%), their consistently low collaboration willingness (<= 4.86%) suggests fundamental limitations of existing LLM in CSE. However, when collaboration occurs, it positively correlates with out-of-sync recovery success.

Weisz, Murray Campbell","Our paper argues that the majority of theory of mind benchmarks are broken because of their inability to directly test how large language models (LLMs) adapt to new partners. This problem stems from the fact that theory of mind benchmarks for LLMs are overwhelmingly inspired by the methods used to test theory of mind in humans and fall victim to a fallacy of attributing human-like qualities to AIagents. We expect that humans will engage in a consistent reasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known to not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only measure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the behavior of others. However, this type of metric is only informative when agents exhibit self-consistent reasoning. Thus, we introduce the concept of functional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following a rational response to their behavior. We find that many open source LLMs are capable of displaying strong literal theory of mind capabilities, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even with exceedingly simple partner policies. Simply put, strong literal theory of mind performance does not necessarily imply strong functional theory of mind performance or vice versa. Achieving functional theory of mind, particularly over long interaction horizons with a partner, is a significant challenge deserving a prominent role in any meaningful LLM theory of mind evaluation.","Submitted 12 June, 2025; v1 submitted 27 December, 2024; originally announced December 2024."

These individuals could benefit greatly from education platforms that leverage the adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. While LLMs have the potential to make topical mental health information more accessible and engaging, their black-box nature raises concerns about ethics and safety. Prompting offers a way to produce semi-scripted chatbots with responses anchored in instructions and validated information, but prompt-engineered chatbots may drift from their intended identity as the conversation progresses. We propose a Critical Analysis Filter for achieving better control over chatbot behavior. In this system, a team of prompted LLM agents are prompt-engineered to critically analyze and refine the chatbot's response and deliver real-time feedback to the chatbot. To test this approach, we develop an informational schizophrenia chatbot and converse with it (with the filter deactivated) until it oversteps its scope. Once drift has been observed, AI-agents are used to automatically generate sample conversations in which the chatbot is being enticed to talk about out-of-bounds topics. We manually assign to each response a compliance score that quantifies the chatbot's compliance to its instructions; specifically the rules about accurately conveying sources and being transparent about limitations. Activating the Critical Analysis Filter resulted in an acceptable compliance score (>=2) in 67.0% of responses, compared to only 8.7% when the filter was deactivated.

This paper introduces AutoPenBench, an open benchmark for evaluating generative agents in automated penetration testing. We present a comprehensive framework that includes 33 tasks, each representing a vulnerable system that the agent has to attack. Tasks are of increasing difficulty levels, including in-vitro and real-world scenarios. We assess the agent performance with generic and specific milestones that allow us to compare results in a standardised manner and understand the limits of the agent under test. We show the benefits of AutoPenBench by testing two agent architectures: a fully autonomous and a semi-autonomous supporting human interaction. We compare their performance and limitations. For example, the fully autonomous agent performs unsatisfactorily achieving a 21% Success Rate (SR) across the benchmark, solving 27% of the simple tasks and only one real-world task. In contrast, the assisted agent demonstrates substantial improvements, with 64% of SR. AutoPenBench allows us also to observe how different LLMs like GPT-4o or OpenAI o1 impact the ability of the agents to complete the tasks.

To optimize performance on resource-constrained devices, we employ model fine-tuning instead of in-context learning, reducing computational costs and energy consumption while improving response times. Our approach involves using GPT-4 to generate diverse planning queries and responses based on available functions, with subsequent validations to ensure data quality. We fine-tune the Phi-3 Mini model on this curated dataset, achieving a 97\% success rate in our in-domain test environment. To address multi-domain planning challenges, we developed a multi-LoRA training method that merges weights from LoRAs trained on distinct function subsets. This approach enables flexible handling of complex, multi-domain queries while maintaining computational efficiency on resource-constrained devices. To support further research, we have open-sourced our model weights at \url{https://huggingface.co/NexaAIDev/octopus-planning}.

Testing the behavior of AIagents in classic Game Theory experiments provides a promising theoretical framework for evaluating the norms and values of these agents in archetypal social situations. In this work, we investigate the cooperative behavior of three LLMs (Llama2, Llama3, and GPT3.5) when playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma against random adversaries displaying various levels of hostility. We introduce a systematic methodology to evaluate an LLM's comprehension of the game rules and its capability to parse historical gameplay logs for decision-making. We conducted simulations of games lasting for 100 rounds and analyzed the LLMs' decisions in terms of dimensions defined in the behavioral economics literature. We find that all models tend not to initiate defection but act cautiously, favoring cooperation over defection only when the opponent's defection rate is low. Overall, LLMs behave at least as cooperatively as the typical human player, although our results indicate some substantial differences among models. In particular, Llama2 and GPT3.5 are more cooperative than humans, and especially forgiving and non-retaliatory for opponent defection rates below 30%. More similar to humans, Llama3 exhibits consistently uncooperative and exploitative behavior unless the opponent always cooperates. Our systematic approach to the study of LLMs in game theoretical scenarios is a step towards using these simulations to inform practices of LLM auditing and alignment.","Submitted 19 September, 2024; v1 submitted 19 June, 2024; originally announced June 2024."

Unfortunately, AIagents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks where data returned by external tools hijacks the agent to execute malicious tasks. To measure the adversarial robustness of AIagents, we introduce AgentDojo, an evaluation framework for agents that execute tools over untrusted data. To capture the evolving nature of attacks and defenses, AgentDojo is not a static test suite, but rather an extensible environment for designing and evaluating new agent tasks, defenses, and adaptive attacks. We populate the environment with 97 realistic tasks (e.g., managing an email client, navigating an e-banking website, or making travel bookings), 629 security test cases, and various attack and defense paradigms from the literature. We find that AgentDojo poses a challenge for both attacks and defenses: state-of-the-art LLMs fail at many tasks (even in the absence of attacks), and existing prompt injection attacks break some security properties but not all. We hope that AgentDojo can foster research on new design principles for AIagents that solve common tasks in a reliable and robust manner..

In Turing-test fashion, the framework is based solely on the agent's performance, and specifically on how well it answers questions. Elements of the framework include circumscribing the set of questions (the ""scope of understanding""), requiring general competence (""passing grade""), avoiding ""ridiculous answers"", but still allowing wrong and ""I don't know"" answers to some questions. Reaching certainty about these conditions requires exhaustive testing of the questions which is impossible for nontrivial scopes, but we show how high confidence can be achieved via random sampling and the application of probabilistic confidence bounds. We also show that accompanying answers with explanations can improve the sample complexity required to achieve acceptable bounds, because an explanation of an answer implies the ability to answer many similar questions. According to our framework, current LLMs cannot be said to understand nontrivial domains, but as the framework provides a practical recipe for testing understanding, it thus also constitutes a tool for building AIagents that do understand.","Submitted 19 June, 2024; v1 submitted 16 June, 2024; originally announced June 2024."

However, LLMs are considered to be general-purpose models for NLP tasks, which may encounter challenges when applied to complex tasks in specialized fields such as optical networks. In this study, we propose a framework of LLM-empowered optical networks, facilitating intelligent control of the physical layer and efficient interaction with the application layer through an LLM-driven agent (AI-Agent) deployed in the control layer. The AI-Agent can leverage external tools and extract domain knowledge from a comprehensive resource library specifically established for optical networks. This is achieved through user input and well-crafted prompts, enabling the generation of control instructions and result representations for autonomous operation and maintenance in optical networks. To improve LLM's capability in professional fields and stimulate its potential on complex tasks, the details of performing prompt engineering, establishing domain knowledge library, and implementing complex tasks are illustrated in this study.

This paper proposes a ""Turing test for an AI scientist"" to assess whether an AIagent can conduct scientific research independently, without relying on human-generated knowledge. Drawing inspiration from the historical development of science, we propose seven benchmark tests that evaluate an AIagent's ability to make groundbreaking discoveries in various scientific domains. These tests include inferring the heliocentric model from celestial observations, discovering the laws of motion in a simulated environment, deriving the differential equation governing vibrating strings, inferring Maxwell's equations from electrodynamics simulations, inventing numerical methods for initial value problems, discovering Huffman coding for data compression, and developing efficient sorting algorithms. To ensure the validity of these tests, the AIagent is provided with interactive libraries or datasets specific to each problem, without access to human knowledge that could potentially contain information about the target discoveries. The ultimate goal is to create an AI scientist capable of making novel and impactful scientific discoveries, surpassing the best human experts in their respective fields. These ""Turing tests"" serve as intermediate milestones, assessing the AIagent's ability to make discoveries that were groundbreaking in their time. If an AIagent can pass the majority of these seven tests, it would indicate significant progress towards building an AI scientist, paving the way for future advancements in autonomous scientific discovery.

This environment enables the study of how ethical considerations, strategic planning, and negotiation skills impact cooperative outcomes.

As a first step towards evaluating this perceived potential, we investigate the use of LLMs in software pentesting, where the main task is to automatically identify software security vulnerabilities in source code. We hypothesize that an LLM-based AIagent can be improved over time for a specific security task as human operators interact with it. Such improvement can be made, as a first step, by engineering prompts fed to the LLM based on the responses produced, to include relevant contexts and structures so that the model provides more accurate results. Such engineering efforts become sustainable if the prompts that are engineered to produce better results on current tasks, also produce better results on future unknown tasks. To examine this hypothesis, we utilize the OWASP Benchmark Project 1.2 which contains 2,740 hand-crafted source code test cases containing various types of vulnerabilities. We divide the test cases into training and testing data, where we engineer the prompts based on the training data (only), and evaluate the final system on the testing data. We compare the AIagent's performance on the testing data against the performance of the agent without the prompt engineering. We also compare the AIagent's results against those from SonarQube, a widely used static code analyzer for security testing.

Learning from language feedback (LLF) is essential for people, largely because the rich information this feedback provides can help a learner avoid much of trial and error and thereby speed up the learning process. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently enabled AIagents to comprehend natural language -- and hence AIagents can potentially benefit from language feedback during learning like humans do. But existing interactive benchmarks do not assess this crucial capability: they either use numeric reward feedback or require no learning at all (only planning or information retrieval). LLF-Bench is designed to fill this omission. LLF-Bench is a diverse collection of sequential decision-making tasks that includes user recommendation, poem writing, navigation, and robot control. The objective of an agent is to interactively solve these tasks based on their natural-language instructions and the feedback received after taking actions. Crucially, to ensure that the agent actually ""learns"" from the feedback, LLF-Bench implements several randomization techniques (such as paraphrasing and environment randomization) to ensure that the task isn't familiar to the agent and that the agent is robust to various verbalizations. In addition, LLF-Bench provides a unified OpenAI Gym interface for all its tasks and allows the users to easily configure the information the feedback conveys (among suggestion, explanation, and instantaneous performance) to study how agents respond to different types of feedback.

Previous works have identified certain SU limitations in non-chatbot Large Language models (LLMs), but the extent and causes of these limitations are not well understood, and capabilities of current chat-based models in this domain have not been explored. In this work we tackle these questions, proposing a novel synthetic environment for SU testing which allows us to do controlled and systematic testing of SU in chat-oriented models, through assessment of models' ability to track and enumerate environment states. Our environment also allows for close analysis of dynamics of model performance, to better understand underlying causes for performance patterns. We apply our test to ChatGPT, the state-of-the-art chatbot, and find that despite the fundamental simplicity of the task, the model's performance reflects an inability to retain correct environment states across time. Our follow-up analyses suggest that performance degradation is largely because ChatGPT has non-persistent in-context memory (although it can access the full dialogue history) and it is susceptible to hallucinated updates -- including updates that artificially inflate accuracies.
