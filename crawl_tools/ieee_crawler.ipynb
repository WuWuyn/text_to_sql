      "Authors: Manasi Ganti, Laurel Orr, Sen Wu\n",
      "PDF Link: None\n",
      "Abstract: Text-to-SQL generation models, capable of converting natural language prompts into SQL queries, offer significant potential for streamlining data analytics tasks. Despite state-of-the-art performance on popular academic benchmarks such as Spider [1], recent large language models, such as GPT-4, exhibit a considerable performance degradation on real-world applications with longer, more convoluted schemas [2]. This disparity raises questions about what factors contribute to this drop and whether existing academic benchmarks are effective for representing real-world challenges. To determine these factors, we first examine Text-to-SQL model failures on customer logs. We find that accuracy on customer logs was on average 30% lower than accuracy on Spider. We identify three main challenges in real-world Text-to-SQL applications: long context length, unclear question formulation, and greater query complexity. With these insights, we create a new benchmark built from manually labeled customer logs and evaluate existing open source and private LLMs to demonstrate the impact of each factor on model performance. The benchmark incorporates 20 non-join queries and 30 join queries, each accompanied by three additional question phrasing variations, resulting in 200 queries total. To capture the effects of large schemas, we vary schema size from 5 to over 300 columns while retaining the minimum columns required to answer all questions. We assess the performance of prominent Text-to-SQL models, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, BigCode's Starcoder [3], and NSQL Llama-2 [4] on both our benchmark and the Spider benchmark for comparative analysis. We use Spider execution accuracy to measure model performance. The evaluation results reveal a) A consistent decline in execution accuracy for longer schemas, dropping about 0.5 percentage points for every additional 10 columns, indicating that existing Text-to-SQL models struggle with progressively larger tables and schema lengths that are character...\n",

      "Abstract: The task of converting natural language queries into SQL queries, known as Text-to-SQL, plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between human language and database systems. However, Text-to-SQL systems face numerous chal-lenges due to the inherent complexity of natural language understanding and the structural differences between text and SQL. On the one hand, the accuracy of SQL generation of previous Text-to-SQL models needs to be further improved. On the other hand, the robustness of previous Text-to-SQL models is not enough, so the usability is not strong enough. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Sequential Feature Augmentation Method (SFAM) to enhance the robustness of Text-to-SQL models. In SFAM, we generate a corresponding augmented feature sequence for each preliminary feature sequence in the text encoding stage. To strengthen the ability of Text-to-SQL model to distinguish the original sequence features and the augmented sequence features, we designed a method based on sequential consistency learning. In addition, we design a pooling method based on attention mechanism and mutual information maximization to reduce the loss of information during pooling. Constrained by these methods during training, our model not only greatly increases robustness but also achieves better accuracy of SQL generation. We construct a dataset based on the marketing business data of the State Grid Corporation of China. Experiments on this dataset demonstrate our SFAM can achieve state-of-the-art effects on the Text-to-SQL task. Besides, to verify the robustness of our model, we randomly sample some data in the test set of the above dataset, and generate synthetic queries based on ChatGPT. Experiments on this test set verify the robustness of our SFAM.\n",

      "Abstract: The text-to-SQL task is a realistic and challenging job, which aims to translate natural language questions into corresponding SQL queries. When attempting to generate SQL queries in the text-to-SQL task, prevailing semantic parsing models employ beam search to generate several candidates. Based on our pilot study, we observe that the gold-standard SQL answer may exist in the n-best candidate list produced by the decoder, rather than the first. Hence, we aim to lift the correct answer given several candidates generated by semantic parsing models for text-to-SQL. To this end, we propose a reranking module that reorders the n-best list of candidate SQL queries by pair-wise hinge loss. Meanwhile, a data augmentation module is leveraged to enrich the inadequate training instances for providing candidates with better qualities. These two modules can be easily grafted onto text-to-SQL backbone networks, and extensive experiments on the cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmark Spider demonstrate that our method achieves 73.8% in accuracy on the Spider dataset, surpassing the base model by up to 3.5%.\n",

      "Abstract: The objective of the text-to-SQL task is to convert natural language queries into SQL queries However, the presence of extensive text-to-SQL datasets across multiple domains, such as Spider, introduces the challenge of effectively generalizing to unseen data. Existing semantic parsing models have struggled to achieve notable performance improvements on these cross-domain datasets. As a result, recent advancements have focused on leveraging pre-trained language models to address this issue and enhance performance in text-to-SQL tasks. These approaches represent the latest and most promising attempts to tackle the challenges associated with generalization and performance improvement in this field. This paper proposes an approach to evaluate and use the Seq2Seq model providing the encoder with the most pertinent schema items as the input and to generate accurate and valid cross-domain SQL queries using the decoder by understanding the skeleton of the target SQL query. The proposed approach is evaluated using Spider dataset which is a well-known dataset for text-to-sql task and able to get promising results where the Exact Match accuracy and Execution accuracy has been boosted to 72.7% and 80.2% respectively compared to other best related approaches.\n",

      "Abstract: The task of converting natural language text to SQL queries has gained significant attention, particularly with the advancement of large language models (LLMs). However, research focused on text-to-SQL systems in non-English languages, such as Turkish, remains limited. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, T5, and SQLCoder, on the TUR2SQL dataset-a cross-domain Turkish text-to-SQL dataset. Our experiments highlight the critical role of schema context in enhancing the accuracy of SQL generation, particularly for the T5 model, which showed significant improvements in logical-form and execution accuracy when fine-tuned with schema context. This study provides valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying LLMs to Turkish text-to-SQL tasks, underscoring the importance of model fine-tuning and schema linking for accurate S Q L query generation in low-resource languages.\n",

      "Abstract: The field of converting natural language into corresponding SQL queries using deep learning techniques has attracted significant attention in recent years. While existing Text-to-SQL datasets primarily focus on English and other languages such as Chinese, there is a lack of resources for the Turkish language. In this study, we introduce the first publicly available cross-domain Turkish Text-to-SQL dataset, named TUR2SQL. This dataset consists of 10,809 pairs of natural language statements and their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted experiments using SQLNet and ChatGPT on the TUR2SQL dataset. The experimental results show that SQLNet has limited performance and ChatGPT has superior performance on the dataset. We believe that TUR2SQL provides a foundation for further exploration and advancements in Turkish language-based Text-to-SQL research.\n",

      "Abstract: Text-to-SQL is one of the most prominent areas where Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen extensive application. While Text-to-SQL systems using LLMs and pre-trained deep learning models are evaluated using standard metrics such as Exact Match (EM), Execution Accuracy (EX), and Valid Efficiency Score (VES), they overlook a critical aspect: consistency. This paper introduces a Consistency metric that evaluates a model’s reliability in generating the same SQL query for repeated inputs. In the study, we performed a comparative analysis of the pre-trained deep learning models and large language models (LLMs) using the Spider dataset. The study highlights that the pre-trained deep learning models tend to be more accurate, efficient, and consistent compared to LLMs. LLMs are consistently incorrect, and consistency alone does not guarantee correctness. As the difficulty of SQL queries increases, LLMs struggle more with accuracy, while the pre-trained deep learning models remain more robust. The paper’s findings suggest that consistency, combined with existing metrics, is essential for improving Text-to-SQL systems.\n",

      "Abstract: Conversational, multi-turn, text-to-SQL (CoSQL) tasks map natural language utterances in a dialogue to SQL queries. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems use large, pre-trained and finetuned language models, such as the T5-family, in conjunction with constrained decoding. With multi-tasking (MT) over coherent tasks with discrete prompts during training, we improve over specialized text-to-SQL T5-family models. Based on Oracle analyses over n-best hypotheses, we apply a query plan model and a schema linking algorithm as rerankers. Combining MT and reranking, our results using T53B show absolute accuracy improvements of 1.0% in exact match and 3.4% in execution match over a SOTA baseline on CoSQL. While these gains consistently manifest at turn level, context dependent turns are considerably harder. We conduct studies to tease apart errors attributable to domain and compositional generalization, with the latter remaining a challenge for multi-turn conversations, especially in generating SQL with unseen parse trees.\n",

      "Abstract: Text-to-SQL translates natural language questions into SQL queries which can be executed on tables to obtain answers. The translation accuracy depends on the integrated understanding of questions and tables, between which there would be extensive semantic gap. However, previous methods specialize in investigating and utilizing simple and common relational information, rather than complex and professional relational information. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid knowledge-guided question and table understanding model (KG-SQL) to improve text-to-SQL translation by bridging the semantic gap between questions and tables. It depicts the semantic relationship between components of questions and tables as a hybrid graph resorting to language knowledge, world knowledge and task-specific knowledge, and integrates these kinds of knowledge in the hybrid graph dynamically. Experiments on WikiSQL and Spider show that, this strategy can effectively integrate different kinds of knowledge, and lead to significant improvement over strong baselines built upon large-scaled pre-trained language models.\n",

      "Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a technology that converts natural language queries into the structured query language SQL. A novel research approach that has recently gained attention focuses on methods based on the complexity of SQL queries, achieving notable performance improvements. However, existing methods entail significant storage and training costs, which hampers their practical application. To address this issue, this paper introduces a method for Text-to-SQL based on Refined Schema and Hardness Prompt. By filtering out low-relevance schema information with a refined schema and identifying query hardness through a Language Model (LM) to form prompts, this method reduces storage and training costs while maintaining performance. It's worth mentioning that this method is applicable to any sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) LM. Our experiments on the Spider dataset, specifically with large-scale LMs, achieved an exceptional Execution accuracy (EX) of 82.6%, demonstrating the effectiveness and greater suitability of our method for real-world applications.\n",

      "Abstract: Large amounts of patient data are stored in Electronic Medical Records (EMR), however querying these databases is complex, and often requires specialized training that medical professionals typically do not have. Data retrieval in this manner can be inefficient, and can delay clinical decision making and impact patient outcomes. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising results in natural language processing tasks, but there are few comprehensive studies on the comparison of their effectiveness on text to SQL applications in the healthcare domain. To fill this gap, we compare a wide range of open source LLMs for text to SQL tasks in healthcare based on the MIMICSQL dataset, which is based on the MIMIC-III database, a large, single center dataset with rich critical care patient records. In particular, we evaluated the performance of several open source models, including Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.1 70B, Mixtral-8x7b, Gemma2-9b, and Gemma2-2b, and found that the Llama3.1-70B model performed best at generating correct SQL queries in terms of exact match and logic form accuracy. To support the selection of LLMs for clinical decision support systems, this work identifies models that facilitate access to critical patient information.\n",

      "Abstract: In text-to-SQL tasks, it is important to construct a model that is applicable in databases of different domains, and how to improve the generalization and induction capabilities of the model is a pivot challenge to be addressed. Traditional approaches are limited by the following shortcomings: 1) limited to transductive models, which do not perform as well as inductive models when generating embeddings for unseen nodes of graphs in cross-domain scenarios; 2) insufficient attention to the importance of structural information in relational databases and do not distinguish local and non-local relations. Therefore, we propose a Mixed Node and Edge Graph SAmple and aggreGatE text-to-SQL model, MNEGraphSAGE for short, which is based on graph sampling and propagation algorithm for node and edge features and converges faster. We give full attention to graph network edge features by mixing the iterative process of edge features and node features in parallel. We also adopt different aggregation methods for edge features of different distances. In the Spider dataset covering multiple domains, our method achieves 64.02% without the help of pre-trained models, outperforming other models of the same size.\n",

      "Abstract: In the Text-to-SQL task, a significant challenge is enabling parsers to generalize effectively across diverse domains. Key to solving is schema-linking, which involves mapping words to the pertinent columns or tables in the databases. Existing methods base on pre-trained language models (PLMs), which rely on token masking, have limitations in capturing the variety of schemas. Unlike single token, phrases offer richer semantics, and superior discrimination in determining whether one word corresponds to tables or columns. In this paper, we present an innovative approach named Phrase-based Schema-Linking for Text-to-SQL (PS-SQL). By incorporating extracted phrases from the question, we enhance PLMs’ ability to learn the mapping between tokens and schemas, leading to more robust schema-linking. We also introduce a mechanism to refine extracted phrases, reducing noise. During practical evaluations on several real-world datasets, PS-SQL consistently delivers enhanced schema-linking precision, resulting in higher-quality SQL query generation.\n",

Under the cross-domain setting, the traditional semantic parse model is difficult to adapt to the invisible database schema. The key to being able to better handle cross-domain issues lies in the encoding method for modeling the natural language utterance and the database schema and establishing alignment between them. We propose a Graph Alignment for cross-domain Text-to-SQL (GASQL) to provide a method that unified encodes the natural language utterance and the database schema. Following the unified encoding method, we propose a well-designed graph alignment module to further learn the alignment between the natural language utterance and the database schema. We conducted experiments on the challenging Spider benchmark, and the results proved that our model can align the natural language utterance and database schema well, and achieved good results.\n",

However, these models still face considerable challenges when applied in practice, such as hallucinations inherent in LLMs and the rigid syntactic structure of SQL, which often lead to the generation of erroneous SQL queries. Existing approaches typically rely on older models or simplistic LLM prompts for direct error correction, which is a relatively basic strategy. In this paper, we explore the performance of large models in the Text-to-SQL error correction task, focusing on the combination of LoRA fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the Splash benchmark, outperforming existing methods and providing more accurate error corrections for SQL generation. Notably, despite using a 7B-parameter model, our method surpasses the performance of much larger 72B-scale models, highlighting the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.\n",

It assesses various LLM models, such as DIN-SQL, DSP, NSQL, GPT, CoPilot, and LLaMa, elucidating their capabilities and contributions. Two critical analyses are presented here. The first compares cutting-edge LLM models using cosine similarity and cost efficiency metrics. The second analysis enhances GPT’s precision through prompt engineerings, like few-shot techniques, and explores frameworks like DIN-SQL, NSQL, and DSP. DIN-SQL substantially boosts accuracy, and NSQL demonstrates potential in specific scenarios. This research underscores the transformative potential of LLM-driven models in business intelligence and inventory management. DIN-SQL, in particular, emerges as a game-changer with the potential to reshape inventory management practices. GPT showcases its versatility through fine-tuning for tasks beyond conventional programming, while CoPilot offers a cost-effective alternative. This study emphasizes the importance of cost-effectiveness in real-world applications, with LLaMa and CoPilot being practical choices.

One of the main current approaches is finetuning pretrained language models (PLMs), which leverages the language knowledge encoded in PLMs to adapt to a new specific task. In this paper, we investigate both the effects of different PLMs, including monolingual and multilingual PLMs, and the impacts of learning methods on the Vietnamese Text-to-SQL task.

      "Abstract: Text-to-SQL aims to parse natural language problems into SQL queries, which can provide a simple interface to access large databases enabling SQL novices a quicker entry into databases. As the Text-to-SQL field is intensively studied, more and more models use GNNs to encode heterogeneous graph information in this task, and how to better obtain path information between nodes in database schema heterogeneous graphs and question-database schema heterogeneous graphs will greatly affect the effectiveness of the model parsing. Our work intends to explore the problem of solving the encoding of heterogeneous graph meta-paths in the Text-to-SQL task. Previous approaches usually use multi-layer GNNs to aggregate topological structure information between nodes. However, they ignored the structural information embedded at the edges and also failed to obtain nodes that are not directly connected but can provide contextual information through meta-paths. To solve the above problem, we propose Multi-Hop Relational Graph Attention Network based Text-to-SQL Parsing Model (MHRGATSQL) for learning topological information between nodes while obtaining semantic information embedded in the edge topology. We use multi-hop attention to modify the relational graph attention network to diffuse the attention scores throughout the network, thus increasing the “receptive field” of each layer of RGAT. Experimental results on the large-scale cross-domain Text-to-SQL dataset Spider show that our model obtains an absolute improvement of 1.7% compared to the baseline and alleviates the over-smoothing problem in the deep network model.\n",

      "Abstract: The task of text-to-SQL aims to convert natural language questions into executable SQL queries within relational databases. This greatly enhances the usability of relational database querying, alleviating the difficulties faced by users who are not proficient in SQL. A major challenge in text-to-SQL task is the model's ability to recognize entities accurately. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes a language model with an integrated relation-aware mechanism for text-to-SQL, named IRAM-SQL. We explore the adaptability of pretrained models for downstream text-to-SQL tasks, ultimately selecting CodeT5+ as the pretrained model, which is trained on a large dataset of source code and annotation, exploring the shared representation between natural language and code. Therefore, the model's ability to generate structured sentences would be explored during the pretraining phase. At the same time, we also integrate a relation-aware mechanism throughout the model fine-tuning process. To this end, we comprehensively models the relational information between natural language questions and database schemas, integrating these relationships effectively within the encoder and decoder of the Transformer architecture. Two denoising tasks is employed during training to help the model learn these relationships more effectively. The integration of relational information during encoding and decoding, along with the emphasis on entity awareness in the training tasks, enhances the model's entity recognition capabilities. We evaluate our proposed framework on the SPIDER dataset and three of its robustness variants: SPIDER-SYN, SPIDER-DK, and SPIDER-REALISTIC. Experimental results indicate that IRAM-SQL, with its comprehensively integrated relation-aware mechanism, demonstrates strong performance and robustness.\n",

      "Abstract: A Database Management System (DBMS) is typically accessed using a Structured Query Language (SQL). Here, we investigate a structured method to parse questions in natural language. Our work is a text-to-SQL translator for scholarly publication database search. The work includes implementation of a phrase-based information retrieval and a Text-to-SQL translator. The information retrieval is emphasizes on the recognition of Named Entity (NE), Named Entity Attribute (NEA), Question Intention (QI) and Focus Recognition. NE is a database entry and NEA is the attribute or column name of the corresponding NE entry. QI is the type of a question. The proposed translator is a domain-specific Text-to-SQL translator. Therefore the scope for named entities is limited to the database values. Thus, we use the database itself as a knowledge-base. We derive rules comprised of phrases, predicates and substitution strings. The phrases are regular expressions and the predicates are stop-words. The usual practice of natural language processing removes stop words. Instead, we make use of many stop words as predicates, thus helping the recognition of NE, NEA and QI. The text cosine similarity measure is used to validate NE, NEA and QI. The rule-based approach is computationally effective and does not require any exhaustive training on the dataset, while providing precise translation.\n",

Specifically, we benchmark Text-to-SQL performance, the evaluation methodologies, as well as input optimization (e.g., prompting). In light of the empirical observations that we have made, we propose two novel metrics that were designed to adequately measure the similarity between SQL queries. Overall, we share with the community various findings, notably on how to select the right LLM on Text-to-SQL tasks. We further demonstrate that a tree-based edit distance constitutes a reliable metric for assessing the similarity between generated SQL queries and the oracle for benchmarking Text2SQL approaches. This metric is important as it relieves researchers from the need to perform computationally expensive experiments such as executing generated queries as done in prior works. Our work implements financial domain use cases and, therefore contributes to the advancement of Text2SQL systems and their practical adoption in this domain.\n",

However, most existing methods do well in translating the question semantics into the SQL, but cannot correctly align the SQL with the database schema (e.g., the primary keys), which leads to several errors in the generated SQL. To tackle the problem, we design SA-SQL, a novel schema-aligned framework for text-to-SQL task following the draft-and-correction manner. First, we select the question-relevant tables and columns from the whole schema with a selector to exclude the noise for generating a concise SQL and reduce the input length. Next, based on the selected tables and columns, we generate a draft of the SQL with a generator to capture the question semantics. Last, considering the alignment between the SQL and the database schema, we design a corrector to detect and correct the possible errors in the draft. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used dataset for text-to-SQL, and our framework has achieved comparable execution accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods on the Spider dataset and BIRD dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our framework.\n",

      "Abstract: This paper introduces TURSpider, a novel Turkish Text-to-SQL dataset developed through human translation of the widely used Spider dataset, aimed at addressing the current lack of complex, cross-domain SQL datasets for the Turkish language. TURSpider incorporates a wide range of query difficulties, including nested queries, to create a comprehensive benchmark for Turkish Text-to-SQL tasks. The dataset enables cross-language comparison and significantly enhances the training and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in generating SQL queries from Turkish natural language inputs. We fine-tuned several Turkish-supported LLMs on TURSpider and evaluated their performance in comparison to state-of-the-art models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. Our results show that fine-tuned Turkish LLMs demonstrate competitive performance, with one model even surpassing GPT-based models on execution accuracy. We also apply the Chain-of-Feedback (CoF) methodology to further improve model performance, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple LLMs. This work provides a valuable resource for Turkish NLP and addresses specific challenges in developing accurate Text-to-SQL models for low-resource languages.\n",

      "Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a fundamental natural language processing (NLP) task that involves translating natural language queries related to a specified relational database into SQL queries. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a crucial paradigm in the Text-to-SQL task. Despite their success, current methods heavily depend on closed-source LLMs with a large number of parameters, such as ChatGPT and GPT4, resulting in significant API costs and privacy concerns. Therefore, a more cost-effective strategy is to fine-tune open-source LLMs with smaller parameters for SQL generation. However, this alternative strategy faces challenges due to the weaker reasoning capabilities of open-source LLMs, particularly in generating complex SQL queries. To address this issue, we propose a Chain-of-Programs (COP) prompting framework for Text-to-SQL. Different from the conventional Chain-of-Thoughts (COT), we utilize Pandas code as an intermediate representation aligned with the step-wise nature of human thinking. This decomposition transforms complex SQL queries into a series of simple Pandas queries. Each step in the COP can be validated using a Python interpreter. Finally, we use the COP prompting to generate SQL queries. Experiments conducted on the Spider dataset using two open-source large language models have demonstrated that our performances are comparable to GPT4 in zero-shot scenario.\n",

      "Abstract: This research presents IDSpider, a new standard dataset for Text-to-SQL research in Indonesian, developed by translating the well-established Spider dataset into Indonesian. Text-to-SQL is a critical technology that bridges the gap between natural language processing (NLP) and database management systems, allowing non-technical users to retrieve data from databases using simple, natural language queries. However, most existing datasets are in English, leaving nonEnglish languages, especially Indonesian, underrepresented in the field. This paper describes the challenges encountered in translating both natural language questions and SQL queries, given the need for precision in maintaining SQL syntax and database structure integrity. We implemented a four-stage process consisting of Extraction, Translation, Cleaning, and Conversion to generate the IDSpider dataset. Furthermore, we tested the performance of the BRIDGE model on both the original Spider dataset and the translated IDSpider dataset. Results show that while the BRIDGE model performs well on Spider, its performance drops significantly when applied to IDSpider, primarily due to language differences and translation complexities. This research establishes the first benchmark for Indonesian Text-to-SQL tasks and lays the groundwork for further improvements in cross-lingual natural language interfaces for databases.\n",

      "Abstract: Text-to-SQL (converting the natural utterance into the structured query language) is an important task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In previous works., we proposed a pipelined text-to-SQL model-SPSQL. SPSQL disassembles the text-to-SQL task into four subtasks: table selection., column selection., SQL generation., and value filling., and then completes the above subtasks in turn by a text classification submodel., a sequence labeling submodel., and two text generation submodels. However., SPSQL still has some defects that prevent the model from further improvement. Firstly., the selection of submodels lacks careful consideration., making submodels not suitable for subtasks enough. Secondly., in the process of generating similar texts using simBERT for natural utterances., there are cases of generating texts with opposite meanings. Thirdly., table/column selection models encountered situations where no table/column is selected during the inference process. Based on this., this paper proposes an advanced version: SPSQL-2. Specifically., we first adjust the corresponding submodel based on the characteristics of each subtask and the inference effects to reconstruct the model. Then., we introduce RoFormer-Sim instead of simBERT to generate similar text of natural utterances. Finally., we construct the “prevent empty table” module and “prevent empty column” module., and insert them into the table selection submodel and column selection submodel respectively. The insertion of these modules prevents the occurrence of no table or column being selected during the inference process. In addition., we construct the dataset based on the power dispatch and control data of the State Grid Corporation of China. Experiments demonstrate our measures in model construction., data augmentation., and (table and column selection) submodel optimization effectively improve the effect of the original model.\n",

      "Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task has significant application prospects in automating relational database query interfaces. It can reduce user learning costs and improve data query efficiency. However, in Text-to-SQL tasks, there is often a phenomenon of semantic gaps and insufficient information due to the absence of columns or condition values required by SQL statements explicitly mentioned in the natural language queries. In this paper, a deep learning approach based on sketch filling is proposed to address the issues of insufficient information and semantic gaps in natural language queries. To tackle the problem of insufficient information, the model preprocesses the natural language queries, marks the named entities associated with the database table schema and content, and augments the data by randomly swapping entities. This augmentation strengthens the training of common natural language query templates, improving the model’s accuracy in predicting results for typical questions. To address the issue of semantic gaps, the model introduces the missing table content from the natural language queries during semantic encoding. An attention mechanism is used to enhance the representation of table content, enabling the Text-to-SQL model to better understand queries and improve performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves better results on two benchmarks. Regarding the content augmentation methods proposed, ablation experiments show that both the data augmentation and table content enhancement schemes can improve the model’s performance.\n",

It aims to address the problem of the complex and cross-domain text-to-SQL generation task. The corpus is trained as the input word vector of the model with LSTM and Word2Vec embedding technology. Combined with the dependency graph method, the problem of SQL statement generation is converted to slot filling. Complex tasks are divided into four levels via F-SemtoSql and constructed by the need of aggregation. At the same time, to avoid the order problem in the traditional model effectively, we have adopted the attention mechanism and used a fuzzy decision mechanism to improve the model decision. On the challenging text-to-SQL benchmark Spider and the other three datasets, F-SemtoSql achieves faster convergence and occupies the first position.\n",

      "Abstract: This paper studies multi-turn text-to-SQL generation, which is a new but important task in semantic parsing. In order to deal with its two challenges, i.e., multi-turn interaction and cross-domain evaluation, this paper proposes a multiple-integration encoder, which derives the vector representations of user utterances and database schemas using three custom-designed modules for information integration. First, an utterance representation enhancing module is built to integrate the information of history utterances into the representation of each token in current utterance by attentive selection. Second, a schema discrepancy enhancing module is designed to integrate previous predicted SQL query into the representation of schema items. Third, a latent schema linking module is employed to integrate schema information into utterance representations for better dealing with unseen database schemas. These three modules are all implemented based on a lightweight multi-head attention mechanism, which reduces the number of parameters in conventional multi-head attention. Experimental results on the SParC dataset show that our method achieved better accuracy of multi-turn text-to-SQL generation than the most advanced benchmarks. Further ablations studies and analysis also demonstrate the effectiveness of the three modules designed for information integration in the encoder.\n",

      "Abstract: Text-to-SQL is the task of converting a natural language utterance plus the corresponding database schema into a SQL program. The inputs naturally form a heterogeneous graph while the output SQL can be transduced into an abstract syntax tree (AST). Traditional encoder-decoder models ignore higher-order semantics in heterogeneous graph encoding and introduce permutation biases during AST construction, thus incapable of exploiting the refined structure knowledge precisely. In this work, we propose a generic heterogeneous graph to abstract syntax tree (HG2AST) framework to integrate dedicated structure knowledge into statistics-based models. On the encoder side, we leverage a line graph enhanced encoder (LGESQL) to iteratively update both node and edge features through dual graph message passing and aggregation. On the decoder side, a grammar-based decoder first constructs the equivalent SQL AST and then transforms it into the desired SQL via post-processing. To avoid over-fitting permutation biases, we propose a golden tree-oriented learning (GTL) algorithm to adaptively control the expanding order of AST nodes. The graph encoder and tree decoder are combined into a unified framework through two auxiliary modules. Extensive experiments on various text-to-SQL datasets, including single/multi-table, single/cross-domain, and multilingual settings, demonstrate the superiority and broad applicability.\n",

This study makes an effort to give readers background information on how the subject has evolved recently using different text-to-SQL procedures and approaches, as well as an appraisal of the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology. In contrast with past studies, this paper describes the search and selection processes and provide an overview of the complete process for each approach under review before making comparisons. The authors also evaluated the performance of each methodology against a widely recognized benchmark dataset. Along with model performance, each model was compared and assessed based on its overall structure and associated processes, such as using pre-trained language models and intermediate representations. The results of this study show that the field of text-to-SQL semantic parsing has advanced significantly in recent years, as seen by the improved performance of the models under consideration. It was clear that most recent developments concentrated on the encoder side, even if each technique follows an encoder-decoder design. The imbalance opens up much room for decoder advancement in subsequent studies. Using pre-trained language models was also noteworthy for improving the models' performances; the authors will consider this for future efforts. The selection of intermediate representations, on the other hand, is wholly arbitrary.\n",

In this paper, we propose to use curriculum learning (CL) to better leverage the curriculum structure of schema, query, and dialog for multi-turn question-query pairs. We design a model-agnostic framework named Schema Enhanced Hybrid Curriculum Learning (SE-HCL) for multi-turn Text-to-SQL to help the models gain a full contextual semantic understanding. Concretely, We measure the difficulty of the data from both a structural and model perspective. In terms of data structure, we mainly consider the turns of the question and the complexity of the schema and SQL query. Accordingly, we designed a data course module to dynamically adjust the difficulty of the data based on the convergence of the model and the schema enhancement method we designed. In terms of the model, we propose a scoring module that will judge the difficulty of a problem based on whether the model could solve the question effectively. Finally, we will consider both aspects and design a hybrid curriculum to determine the flow of model training. Our experiments show that our proposed method improves SQL-generated performance over previous state-of-the-art models on SparC and CoSQL, especially for hard and long-turn questions.\n",

Challenges arise from Thai's unique word segmentation coupled with the presence of SQL keywords and database table columns expressed in English.

After extensive experiments with Seq2Seq models, LLMs, and different prompt engineering techniques, we reached the optimal configuration for our proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches in accurately translating natural language queries into SQL commands.

Additionally, we introduce a novel Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)-based database prompt and a post cell value linking method that effectively describes the schema while avoiding error propagation common in traditional schema linking approaches.

      "Abstract: Text-to-SQL aims to map natural language questions to SQL queries. The sketch-based SQLova model combined with execution-guided (EG) decoding strategy has achieved a super-human performance on the WikiSQL dataset. However, through our fine-grained error analysis, we find that SQLova cannot handle well the aggregation operator selection for nu-meric columns, due to the lack of column type information to distinguish between textual and numeric columns. Besides, most predicted value spans in the WHERE clause have the same meaning with the ground truth, but they do not match exactly, leading to unnecessary errors. Therefore we propose RuleSQLova model, which enhances the SQLova base model with logic rules to deal with these two major weaknesses of SQLova. It first incorporates four logic rules into the model to constrain the aggregation operator prediction for numeric columns, using the general framework of iterative rule knowledge distillation. Then it leverages another logic rule for post-processing before EG decoding to ensure the consistency between predicted value spans and values in the table column. Experimental results indicate that RuleSQLova model offers significant and consistent improvements over SQLova, outperforming competitive sketch-based models on the WikiSQL dataset, and our method also brings improvements to the sketch-based models on the Spider dataset.\n",

For reducing the prediction errors of tables, we use the top-K predicted tables to generate SQL queries and employ a string-matching algorithm to get the most reasonable one. Futhermore, a type linking mechanism is utilized to augment the relevance between utterances and schemas. On the challenging text-to-SQL benchmark SParC, we use previous query attention to get context-dependent information of SQL queries. GuideSQL obtains 36.3% question matching accuracy and 19.5% interaction matching accuracy on the dev set. With BERT augmentation, GuideSQL achieves 49.2% question matching accuracy and 31.6% interaction matching accuracy on the dev set, outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by 2% question matching accuracy and 2.1% interaction matching accuracy.\n",

State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems rely on finetuning large, pre-trained language models in conjunction with constrained decoding applying a SQL parser. On the well established Spider dataset, we begin with Oracle studies: specifically, choosing an Oracle hypothesis from a SOTA model's 10-best list, yields a 7.7% absolute improvement in both exact match (EM) and execution (EX) accuracy, showing significant potential improvements with reranking. Identifying coherence and correctness as reranking approaches, we design a model generating a query plan and propose a heuristic schema linking algorithm. Combining both approaches, with T5-Large, we obtain a consistent 1% improvement in EM accuracy, and a 2.5% improvement in EX, establishing a new SOTA for this task.

      "Abstract: Significant advancements in semantic parsing for text-to-SQL (T2S) tasks have been achieved through the employment of neural network models, such as LSTM, BERT, and T5. The exceptional performance of large language models, such as ChatGPT, has been demonstrated in recent research, even in zero-shot scenarios. However, the inherent transparency of T2S models presents them as black boxes, concealing their inner workings from both developers and users, which complicates the diagnosis of potential error patterns. Despite the fact that numerous visual analysis studies have been conducted in natural language processing communities, scant attention has been paid to addressing the challenges of semantic parsing, specifically in T2S tasks. This limitation hinders the development of effective tools for model optimization and evaluation. This article presents an interactive visual analysis tool, MAVIDSQL, to assist model developers and users in understanding and diagnosing T2S tasks. The system comprises three modules: the model manager, the feature extractor, and the visualization interface, which adopt a model-agnostic approach to diagnose potential errors and infer model decisions by analyzing input–output data, facilitating interactive visual analysis to identify error patterns and assess model performance. Two case studies and interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of MAVIDSQL in facilitating the understanding of T2S tasks and identifying potential errors.\n",

      "Abstract: In natural language processing, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the text-to-SQL task, particularly in single-question interactions. However, multi-turn question interactions present unique challenges not fully addressed by current LLMs like GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive and systematic analysis on a multi-turn interaction dataset known as SParC to compare various existing prompt engineering methods, including prompt representations and in-context learning methods. Following this, we present GAT-SQL, a novel prompt engineering approach based on three techniques: GAT representation, GAT reviser, and GAT verifier. Comparing our GAT representation and GAT verifier techniques to the previous methods of prompt engineering, they were very successful for the zero-shot experiments. GAT representations improve performance by an average of 2.9% EX and 3.8% IX across all existing question representation methods. While GAT verifier results in a greater improvement in accuracy by an average of 3.6% EX and 4% IX. Furthermore, with regard to in-context learning experiments, the GAT reviser achieved 77.4% EX and 59.9% IX, outperforming the best state-of-the-art model by 3.4% EX and 6.4% IX. As a further demonstration of the effectiveness of GAT-SQL, we tested it on another dataset of multi-turn interactions named CoSQL. GAT reviser achieved a new benchmark in the CoSQL competition, achieving 74.5% EX and 50.2% IX, higher than the closest baseline by 6.3% EX and 9.7% IX.\n",

This study addresses the information query needs in the construction safety domain by proposing a graph-structured retrieval-enhanced large model Text-to-SQL optimization method. By standardizing database table information, addressing few-shot problems with example-based and enterprise safety domain knowledge prompt templates, and utilizing graph data-based knowledge retrieval enhancement techniques, the method enhances the large model's business understanding capability in the construction safety field and reduces computational resource consumption. Furthermore, by employing reasoning strategies such as chain-of-thought prompting, easy-to-hard progression, self-consistency, and self-correction, the accuracy of the large model in responding to complex construction safety business questions is significantly improved.

To address this challenge, various data synthesis techniques have been employed to generate more diverse and higher quality data. In this paper, we propose REFORMER, a framework that leverages ChatGPT's prowess without the need for additional training, to facilitate the synthesis of (question, SQL query) pairs tailored to new domains. Our data augmentation approach is based on a “retrieve-and-edit” method, where we generate new questions by filling masked question using explanation of SQL queries with the help of ChatGPT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cycle consistency remains a valuable method of validation when applied appropriately. Our experimental results show that REFORMER consistently outperforms previous data augmentation methods. To further investigate the power of ChatGPT and create a general data augmentation method, we also generate the new data by paraphrasing the question in the dataset and by paraphrasing the description of a new SQL query that is generated by ChatGPT as well. Our results affirm that paraphrasing questions generated by ChatGPT help augment the original data.\n",

To bridge this gap, we conducted vulnerability tests on Text-to-SQL systems that are commonly used to create natural language interfaces to databases. We showed that the Text-to-SQL modules within six commercial applications can be manipulated to produce malicious code, potentially leading to data breaches and Denial of Service attacks. 1 This is the first demonstration that NLP models can be exploited as attack vectors in the wild. In addition, experiments using four open-source language models verified that straightforward backdoor attacks on Text-to-SQL systems achieve a 100% success rate without affecting their performance. The aim of this work is to draw the community’s attention to potential software security issues associated with NLP algorithms and encourage exploration of methods to mitigate against them.\n",

The Transformer model architecture of the NN was justified in the research. This architecture allows the NN to convert an input sequence (such as a natural language text query) into an output sequence (translated into SQL format text query). WikiSQL dataset was used for NN learning and testing. Numerous experiments were conducted in order to determine the optimal parameters of the NN model were conducted.

      "Abstract: Most of existing studies on parsing natural language (NL) for constructing structured query language (SQL) do not consider the complex structure of database schema and the gap between NL and SQL query. In this paper, we propose a schema-aware neural network with decomposing architecture, namely HSRNet, which aims to address the complex and cross-domain Text-to-SQL generation task. The HSRNet models the relationship of the database schema with a hierarchical schema graph and employs a graph network to encode the information into sentence representation. Instead of end-to-end generation, the HSRNet decomposes the generation process into three phases. Given an input question and schema, we first choose the column candidates and generate the sketch grammar of the SQL query. Then, a detail completion module fills the details based on the column candidates and the corresponding sketch. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our hierarchical schema representation by incorporating the information into different baselines. We further show that the decomposing architecture significantly improves the performance of our model. Evaluation of Spider benchmark shows that the hierarchical schema representation and decomposing architecture improves our parser result by 14.5% and 4.3% respectively.\n",

      "Abstract: Text-to-SQL conversion, the process of generating SQL queries from natural language input, has gained significant attention due to its potential to simplify database interaction. Although benchmarks in this task have driven advancements in the field, the challenges posed by complex join logic and the rich diversity of natural language expressions remain significant obstacles. These complexities underscore the ongoing difficulty of accurately bridging the gap between natural language and structured query representations, particularly in cross-domain and real-world scenarios. Recent research, including intermediate representations, relation-aware transformers, and large language models such as T5 and LLaMA, has improved performance by addressing the semantic gap between natural language and SQL. In this work, we propose SLENet, a novel approach that uses state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to enhance semantic understanding and SQL generation. Our method integrates three core innovations: (1) the use of advanced LLMs for context-aware representations, (2) syntax-constrained SQL decoder to ensure grammatical correctness, and (3) search-based prompt optimization utilizing external knowledge sources like WikiSQL. These innovations collectively address schema comprehension and SQL generation complexities. Evaluations on the Spider benchmark demonstrate that SLENet significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher exact matching accuracy and effectively handling complex SQL components. Our contributions highlight the importance of combining LLMs with syntax constraints and external data for advancing cross-domain semantic parsing.\n",

These datasets were selected because of the variety of problems they present: WikiSQL concentrates on effective querying using straightforward single-tables, while BIRD simulates noisy, real-world data scenarios where precise and effective SQL creation is essential. SPIDER analyzes how well models generalize over complex schemas and multi-table queries. We fine-tuned eight models from the LLM families of LLama, Gemma, and Mistral across these datasets with consistent hyper-parameters to tackle these challenges. We used an SQL evaluation framework that examines model generalization, considering both linguistic variety and complex query patterns against a baseline of accuracy and correctness of existing NL-to-SQL models available. This study demonstrates how different models perform across datasets, with some performing better in simpler queries and others being suited for managing inconsistent, real-world data or difficult cross-domain tasks.\n",

      "Abstract: This article studies the application of big model technology combining prompt generation and data insight in power system data analysis, aiming to improve the performance of Text to SQL to meet the complex needs of the power industry. Firstly, this article reviews the development of Text to SQL technology, including traditional rule-based methods and machine learning methods, and points out its shortcomings in handling complex queries. With the introduction of large models, especially the application of GPT series models, Text to SQL has made significant progress in natural language understanding and complex SQL generation. To address the challenges posed by complex queries and the characteristics of power data, this paper proposes a power data analysis framework that combines prompt generation and data insights. By utilizing prompt generation modules and data insight techniques, the model can automatically identify abnormal data and fault patterns, and provide predictive maintenance support. In addition, the Text to SQL method based on prompt generation dynamically generates similar prompts, combined with database schema information, effectively improving the ability to generate complex queries, especially suitable for scenarios involving multi table associations and complex query conditions.\n",

      "Abstract: Relational databases are storage for a massive amount of data. Knowledge of structured query language is a prior requirement to access that data. That is not possible for all non-technical personals, leading to the need for a system that translates text to SQL query itself rather than the user. Text to SQL task is also crucial because of its economic and industrial value. Natural Language Interface to Database (NLIDB) is the system that supports the text-to-SQL task. Developing the NLIDB system is a long-standing problem. Previously they were built based on domain-specific ontologies via pipelining methods. Recently a rising variety of Deep learning ideas and techniques brought this area to the attention again. Now end to end Deep learning models is being proposed for the task. Some publicly available datasets are being used for experimentation of the contributions, making the comparison process convenient. In this paper, we review the current work, summarize the research trends, and highlight challenging issues of NLIDB with Deep learning models. We discussed the importance of datasets, prediction model approaches and open challenges. In addition, methods and techniques are also summarized, along with their influence on the overall structure and performance of NLIDB systems. This paper can help future researchers start having prior knowledge of findings and challenges in NLIDB with Deep learning approaches.\n",

      "Abstract: Converting text into the structured query language (Text2SQL) is a research hotspot in the field of natural language processing (NLP), which has broad application prospects. In the era of big data, the use of databases has penetrated all walks of life, in which the collected data is large in scale, diverse in variety, and wide in scope, making the data query cumbersome and inefficient, and putting forward higher requirements for the Text2SQL model. In practical applications, the current mainstream end-to-end Text2SQL model is not only difficult to build due to its complex structure and high requirements for training data, but also difficult to adjust due to massive parameters. In addition, the accuracy of the model is hard to achieve the desired result. Based on this, this paper proposes a pipelined Text2SQL method: SPSQL. This method disassembles the Text2SQL task into four subtasks——table selection, column selection, SQL generation, and value filling, which can be converted into a text classification problem, a sequence labeling problem, and two text generation problems, respectively. Then, we construct data formats of different subtasks based on existing data and improve the accuracy of the overall model by improving the accuracy of each submodel. We also use the named entity recognition module and data augmentation to optimize the overall model. We construct the dataset based on the marketing business data of the State Grid Corporation of China. Experiments demonstrate our proposed method achieves the best performance compared with the end-to-end method and other pipeline methods.\n",

      "Abstract: Due to tremendous expansion in the banking, business, and IT sectors, data is growing at an exponential rate these days, and the majority of it is stored in relational databases. In order to access and alter information, users must be proficient with languages such as SQL (Structured Query Language). However, the customers are unfamiliar with SQL. As a result, a number of different models have been presented to date to convert English queries into SQL for extracting data from databases to achieve human performance on the dataset. It is an approach toward developing an end-to-end solution that may provide an intuitive text interface for many data sources within the corporate ecosystem, allowing them to obtain real-time data visualization or insights. Some of the models developed to date have already surpassed the 90 % test accuracy on the WikiSQL dataset. However, more research is needed to develop a largely scalable model with higher accuracy on custom and unknown databases. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on different strategies involved in this domain and to understand the contrast between them. We mainly focus on those factors and aspects that impact the performance and accuracy of the task significantly. This paper presents comprehensive research on the most prominent algorithms and analyses them based on different factors.\n",

      "Abstract: A simple way to assess the correctness of a student’s SQL query is to compare results with a correct query for equality. Technically, the two queries will produce identical responses only if they are computationally equivalent. Until recently, establishing such equality largely tested set equality of the returned results at great computational cost with not enough confidence. In most e-Learning systems, providing feedback to improve learning has remained illusive in a setup where no semantic foundation was used to assess the query. In this paper, we present a new e-Learning platform for SQL, called ViSQL, that combines teaching, tutoring and assessment in one single system. We leverage recent development of a query equivalence solver to craft mentoring strategies using automated feedback and guidance to aid learning and scale learner support.\n",

      "Abstract: One of the difficult task for many users on SQL is to write the SQL Query due to its syntax and structure. If a person needs to query a database, they should know everything about how data is distributed and what the internal dependencies are. For this reason, it is not easy for everyone to access data in database without proper knowledge. This paper presents a novel application that leverages generative AI and natural language processing (NLP) to enable users to interact with databases using natural language queries. Built on the Gemini API, the application translates user queries into SQL queries, simplifying database interactions for non-technical users. The Python-based backend, SQLite database management, and Streamlit frontend provide a comprehensive solution for database querying and analysis. This approach democratizes data retrieval and analysis, offering automated insights and visualizations to users of all skill levels. The app also features automated data analysis, which boosts insight generation for users of all skill levels. Further, the traditional ways of querying SQL generally require specialized knowledge and are only accessible to those with technical backgrounds. When the application takes charge of the query construction process and offers data as UI elements, it can invigorate users to have a higher degree of insight into what their data actually is and explore it even more efficiently. The Python software stack combines Python for backend processing, SQLite for database management and a web-based frontend for user interaction to provide an all-encompassing database querying and analysis solution.\n",

This paper analyses the above difficulties and proposes a seq2seq-oriented decoding strategy called SR, which includes a new intermediate representation SSQL and a reranking method with score re-estimator to solve the above obstacles respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques and T5-SR-3b achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Spider dataset.\n",

      "Abstract: This study examines how conversational business analytics can bridge the skill gap of end users that hinders traditional self-service analytics. By leveraging generative AI, conversational business analytics enables end users to independently retrieve data, process it, and generate information. Using Text-to-SQL as an example, this study proposes theoretical models grounded in expected utility theory to examine two levels of AI support: partial support, where AI translates natural language requests into SQL and the generated information serves directly as the basis for decision-making, and full support, which includes an additional validation step. The models define conditions where AI-driven information generation surpasses human delegation. These conditions underscore the critical interplay between AI accuracy and validation effectiveness as pivotal factors for the successful integration of AI. The findings suggest that partial support is viable when the AI accuracy is sufficiently high. In contrast, full support necessitates both adequate accuracy and robust validation. Insufficient validation impairs decisions, highlighting the need for effective validation techniques to fully leverage conversational business analytics. Moreover, the dependence on user-driven validation introduces additional risks, as its effectiveness is contingent on the user’s experience or familiarity with SQL and underlying data structures. This insight challenges conventional validation techniques for AI-generated information and highlights the need to use techniques that reduce the reliance on the technical expertise of end users.\n",

      "Abstract: Database application is at the core of most web application systems such as web-based email, source codes repository management, public scientific data repository management, news portals, and publication repository of various fields. However, the usage of these database systems for data and information retrieval is severely limited because of lacking support for processing search queries expressed in a natural language (NL). Most web interfaces for databases today only take search queries entered in some form of logical combination of keywords or text strings, which restrict the scope and depth of what a web user really wants to search for, even though natural language based data or information retrieval has made significant advances in recent years. To overcome or at least to alleviate such limitation in web information services, we propose in this article an improved neural model based on an existing framework IRNet for NL query of databases, in which a representation of Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN) is introduced to encode the database entities and relations. We also represent and use the database values in the prediction model to identify and match table and column names for automatic synthesize a correct SQL statement from a query expressed in a NL sentence. Experiments with a public dataset demonstrates the promising potential of our approach.\n",

      "Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their ability to process natural language, their potential to transform industries and reshape the future of human-computer interaction becomes increasingly evident. This study evaluates the application of Large Language Models (LLM) to automate SQL query generation from natural language inputs in enterprise environments. We investigated the feasibility of using open-source LLMs, including Mistral, CodeLlama, Phi-3, and DeepSeek Coder, by fine-tuning them with a custom dataset reflecting company-specific data tables. This dataset was iteratively constructed using a baseline LLM that allows fine-tuning to address unique enterprise data structures and use cases. A two-stage filtering and refinement mechanism was implemented to improve query accuracy. The first stage identifies relevant tables and the second stage adds an iterative error correction step to improve the SQL query generation process. The resulting system significantly reduced query errors and increased accuracy by 84%,88%,81%, and 90% for Mistral, CodeLlama, Phi-3, and DeepSeek Coder LLM. However, challenges remain in resource consumption and logical error handling. Future work will focus on improving contextual understanding and integrating advanced AI techniques to further enhance robustness and applicability.\n",

      "Abstract: With the wide application of knowledge graphs in various scenarios and Neo4j graph databases becoming excellent knowledge graph carriers, Cypher (CQL for short) has become the most popular graph database query language. However, when performing graph database retrieval, the complex pattern and syntax make constructing CQL statements a complicated and time-consuming task. Therefore, similar to Text-to-SQL, it is necessary and urgent to study an effective method for end-to-end transformation of natural languages into CQL. There have been many advances in Text-to-SQL for traditional relational databases, but these methods cannot be well applied to Text-to-CQL, so there is still a lack of effective work on Text-to-CQL for graph databases. In recent years, as large language models have been widely applied to different tasks with good results, and considering that the fundamental difference between CQL and SQL is the representation of graph patterns. We propose in this paper PA-LLM, a Text-to-CQL method that utilizes large language models combined with graph patterns enhancement, which combines large language models and subdivides the graph patterns into three categories according to their respective characteristics. They are simple query patterns, multi-hop query patterns, and function query patterns. For different graph patterns, the method optimizes the process of generating CQL for the model, which can be subdivided into four sub-methods, simple pattern enhancement method, multi-hop pattern enhancement method, function pattern enhancement method, and entity-relationship enhancement method. The experimental results show that the method improves the quality of the CQL statements generated by the model, including the logical accuracy ACCLX and the execution result accuracy ACCEX, and achieves better results on the SpCQL dataset proposed by the National Defense University of Science and Technology (NDUST). It provides an effective solution for the task of converting CQL t...\n",

A simple way to develop a speech-to-SQL parser is to pass the speech to an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, and pass the transcription to a text-to-SQL parser. However, ASR is still error-prone. We propose an ASR correction method, DBATI (DataBase-Aware TaggerILM). The method first detects erroneous spans in the input, and rewrites each span. Our method leverages a novel joint representation of text and the database (DB). Our experiments show that our method yields better performance on both text quality and downstream SQL accuracy, compared to existing ASR error correction methods.\n",

      "Abstract: Several applications, such as text-to-SQL and computational fact checking, exploit the relationship between relational data and natural language text. However, state of the art solutions simply fail in managing \"data-ambiguity\", i.e., the case when there are multiple interpretations of the relationship between text and data. Given the ambiguity in language, text can be mapped to different subsets of data, but existing training corpora only have examples in which every sentence/question is annotated precisely w.r.t. the relation. This unrealistic assumption leaves the target applications unable to handle ambiguous cases. To tackle this problem, we present an end-to-end solution that, given a table D, generates examples that consist of text, annotated with its data evidence, with factual ambiguities w.r.t. D. We formulate the problem of profiling relational tables to identify row and attribute data ambiguity. For the latter, we propose a deep learning method that identifies every pair of data ambiguous attributes and a label that describes both columns. Such metadata is then used to generate examples with data ambiguities for any input table. To enable scalability, we finally introduce a SQL approach that can generate millions of examples in seconds. We show the high accuracy of our solution in profiling relational tables and report on how our automatically generated examples lead to drastic quality improvements in two fact-checking applications, including a website with thousands of users, and in a text-to-SQL system.\n",

      "Abstract: Efficiently and accurately retrieving specific information from healthcare datasets, such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) 1, presents significant challenges. A promising solution to this problem is the Text-to-ESQ approach, which is akin to Text-to-SQL tasks but leverages NoSQL database Elasticsearch, to thoroughly explore VAERS data. Non-relational databases are particularly adept at managing complex and dynamic data formats, thereby enabling the extraction of more valuable insights. However, generating executable NoSQL queries is still challenging due to the limited availability of NoSQL query datasets, which constrains model training. One potential remedy involves the use of large language models (LLMs), which can be applied in few-shot and even zero-shot learning scenarios. Nonetheless, the lack of prior evaluation for this novel task, coupled with the absence of a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of existing LLMs and prompting strategies, impedes the development of a robust architecture. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce a new Instruction-Enhanced Explainable (InstructEx) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting by integrating existing CoT prompts and conducting a comprehensive investigation of LLMs and CoT prompting. The extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of using LLMs for Text-to-ESQ when combined with the InstructExCoT prompting. It also sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses of these methods from multiple perspectives.\n",

      "Abstract: Natural language querying (NLQ) is an important research direction in both natural language processing and database communities. Over the past few years, using modern deep learning language generation and semantic parsing techniques to translate natural language questions to SQL queries, namely Text-to-SQL, has become a promising research topic. Despite the many limitations of using SQL queries for searching due to the predefined data structures and functionality of SQL databases, few attempts have been made beyond SQL query generation. Although there are many well-known, efficient, and scalable NoSQL databases and search engines, such as MongoDB and Elasticsearch, very little work has been devoted to developing NLQ tools for them and exploiting their potential. This gap motivates us to forge and explore the new research direction of NLQ on NoSQL databases. This vision paper aims to investigate the unique characteristics of the NoSQL database in the context of NLQ, examine the integration of NLQ with NoSQL databases, identify emerging research opportunities, and outline key challenges and potential research directions. We hope to inspire and stimulate further research investigation into adopting NoSQL databases for NLQ tasks.\n",

      "Converting text to SQL technologies eliminates the requirement for structured languages like SQL by enabling anyone to inspect the RDBMS by submitting questions. Due to the extensive search area, neural semantic parsers (NSPs) frequently fail to convert lengthy and complex utterances into the nested Structured query language (SQL) queries. Natural language query responses over tables are typically viewed as semantic parsing tasks. It is difficult to train semantic parsers from subpar supervision since logical forms produced are only employed as a stage before recovering the connotation. The objective or goal of this comparison in the research is to study all the existing systems for text‐to‐SQL conversion and then find out the drawback of each system. This paper presents the comparison among the different text‐to‐SQL conversion systems. Our thorough assessment tries to close a significant knowledge gap regarding the capabilities and limitations of current systems, and it identifies a number of unresolved issues.\n",

      "Abstract: In the semantic parsing domain, significant progress has been achieved in Text-to-SQL and question-answering tasks, both focused on extracting information from data sources in their native format. However, the inherent constraints of their formal meaning representations, such as SQL programming language, hinder their ability to analyze data from various perspectives, such as conducting statistical analyses. To address this limitation and inspire research in this field, we design SIGMA, a new dataset for Text-to-Code semantic parsing with statistical analysis. SIGMA consists of 6000 questions with corresponding Python code labels. The Python code labels in our dataset cover 4 types of query patterns, which return data in their original format, and 40 types of statistical analysis patterns, which perform statistical operations on the data. We evaluated the SIGMA dataset using three different baseline models: LGESQL, 5mBoP, and SLSQL. The experimental results show that the LGESQL model with ELECTRA outperforms all other models, achieving 83.37% structure accuracy. In terms of execution accuracy, the 5mBoP model, when combined with GraPPa and T5, reaches 76.38%.\n",

      "Abstract: Converting natural language text into executable SQL queries significantly impacts the healthcare domain, specifically when applied to electronic medical records. Given that electronic medical records store extensive patient information in a relational multitable database, developing a Text-to-SQL parser would enable the correlation of intricate medical terminology through semantic parsing. A major challenge is designing a versatile Text2SQL parser applicable to new databases. A critical step towards this goal involves schema linking - accurately identifying references to previously unseen columns or tables during SQL creation. In response to these key challenges, we propose a novel framework—Linking Information Enhanced Text2SQL Parsing on Complex Electronic Medical Records (LI-EMRSQL). This model leverages the Poincaré distance metric detection procedure, utilizing induced relations to enhance the performance of pre-existing graph-based parsers and improve schema linkage. To enhance the generalizability of LI-EMRSQL, the detection process is completely unsupervised and does not necessitate additional parameters. On two conventional Text2SQL datasets and two EMRs Text2SQL datasets, the system delivers SOTA performance. Furthermore, notable enhancements in the model's comprehension and alignment of schemas are observed.\n",

      "Abstract: The exponential increase in data volume, the growing pervasiveness of digital technologies, and frequent data breaches have given rise to a broad range of privacy concerns. These concerns stem from the fact that data privacy measures have not kept pace with the scale and heterogeneity of sensitive data being produced, leading to unauthorized and unintended access, especially in multi-party scenarios. In the context of enterprises and individuals, data is one of the most important crown jewels to be protected. Current data protection frameworks struggle to regulate data sharing across multiple parties due to the existence of varying data access rules, and privacy and data governance policies across these institutions and individuals. The notion of Ring Fencing has been used in the financial sector to create a virtual barrier that isolates a portion of a company's financial assets to mitigate risk. In this paper, we propose to leverage this concept in order to enhance data security through the integration of a Data Ring Fencing architecture. Our Data Ring Fencing framework offers a multi-layered security paradigm that models privacy-preserving data-sharing agreements across multiple institutions. It achieves this goal by governing data privileges and regulating who can access what and for what purpose, and at what cost. Our data ring fencing framework supports three phases: Evaluate, Enforce, and Execute (referred to as the Three-E architecture). The Three-E architecture leverages deep learning-based models such as BERT + Multiclass LR for query classification and Transfer Learning on a sequence-to-sequence model for text-to SQL generation. We demonstrate a practical application of the Three-E architecture based on Data Ring Fencing using a multi-institution instance from the healthcare domain. After conducting extensive experimentation on our custom datasets, our BERT + Multiclass LR model gave us the best performance achieving more than 99% accuracy.\n",

      "Abstract: A natural language interface to query databases (NLIDB) permits users to access data stored in databases by typing queries stated in some natural language. It is typical for the elements in a SQL statement to refer to specific information in the database table rather than being expressly mentioned in the natural language query. As a result, it is vital to gauge the similarity of two texts from the standpoint of semantics rather than strings because it can be challenging to deduce the proper element values purely based on the original query in this circumstance. It can be challenging for a text-to-SQL model to decide which column to utilize if the query includes numerous columns with identical semantics. First, the column representations are improved using table contents, and then, the query representation is improved using the revised column representations. As a result of the efficiency of the column contents being less than ideal, a small-scale introduction is planned. A generic module for use in nlidb systems that enables such systems to conduct queries using aggregations is presented in great detail in this survey. These methods include query-based, pattern-based, general, keyword-based, and grammar-based systems.\n",

Our results show that most configurations are sub-optimal, with only a few offering a favorable trade-off between accuracy and cost. Highlighting the critical need for systematic exploration, we show that extensive experimentation is expensive, underscoring the importance for cost-effective methods to navigate the configuration space.

      "Abstract: Currently, the research field of Natural Language Generated SQL (NL2SQL) mainly focuses on generic datasets, aiming to build models that can parse natural language queries and automatically generate SQL statements. However, this generic exploration often ignores the complexity and idiosyncrasies of intra-enterprise data, such as industry-specific terminology, data structure differences, and security compliance requirements, resulting in the fact that the existing NL2SQL technology can only cover the more basic query requirements in practical applications, and is difficult to be deeply integrated into the business scenarios of enterprises. This paper aims to fill this research gap by focusing on the customized application of NL2SQL technology to specific internal enterprise environments, and adopting LLM+RAG+Reminiscence Engineering+Intelligent Body Feedback to design and implement a set of NL2SQL system that can be applied to internal enterprises. After practical project verification, the system’s ability to generate SQL in an enterprise-oriented financial data environment can be improved from 54% to about 70%, and the accuracy of multi-round dialog can be further improved. This system enables the seamless connection between natural language and enterprise database, which provides strong support for enterprise digital transformation.\n",

      "Abstract: Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) meticulously document patient information in relational databases, presenting a challenging task for medical professionals to effectively retrieve this data. Natural Language Question to SQL query (NL2SQL), a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), shows promising performance in addressing this challenge. However, existing medical NL2SQL studies often focus on generating SQL queries from monolingual questions in English. None of them have studied medical NL2SQL for the Chinese domain.In Chinese EMRs, the questions are primarily in Chinese, while many medical terms, such as drugs and diseases, are commonly described in English. This phenomenon is generally known as code-switching (CS) in the field. Given that underlying systems are typically monolingual, CS has proven to pose significant accuracy challenges, as observed in many tasks such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT). However, the potential effects on EMRs NL2SQL have not been explored. In this study, we investigate the CS-NL2SQL problem, focusing on CS in the context of Chinese questions for the NL2SQL task on EMRs. To assess the model’s performance on this task, we construct the first CS-NL2SQL dataset named CS-MIMICSQL in medical domains. We then explore different CS-NL2SQL architectures along two dimensions: cascaded (translation followed by SQL generation) vs. end-to-end. Our results demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end structure can outperform much better than the cascaded baselines.\n",

In this work, we propose an approach for NL2SQL using artificial neural networks embedded with pre-training and fine-tuning model, where we use XLNet as the encoding layer for the model, this method is able to better capture the hidden semantic information between natural language and table header of dataset. To make more use of the related information, the table header type information is enhanced in our model. In particular we introduce this information into the calculation of probability values at the output layer. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested with good performance on WikiSql dataset, nearly 81% accuracy is achieved on the dev dataset.\n",

      "Abstract: To make databases more accessible to a much broader audience of non-technical users, many applications, such as chatbots and search engines, have developed a natural language (NL) interface for the underlying databases (NLIDB). With the advances in machine learning techniques, most recent research employs language translation models to build NLIDB systems. In this demonstration, we introduce GenSql, a generative NLIDB system that enables users to query databases using NL. Unlike most existing NLIDB systems that attempt to leverage a generalized language translation model to convert NL to SQL queries (NL2SQL) for any database, GenSql utilizes a set of sample queries to capture the specific structure and semantics of a given database and thus to provide more accurate translation results. The underlying NL2SQL model in GenSql is a novel generate-and-rank model named Gar designed by the authors, which first generates a set of generalized SQL queries with corresponding NL expressions from the given sample queries, and ranks the NL expressions to get the best matching one, and hence the SQL query. This demonstration shows the effectiveness of GenSql, especially in answering complex queries, which proves its utility in practice.\n",

This paper presents an NL2SQL approach that incorporates table structure information. Initially, the method involves associating the question with the corresponding data table column name to acquire input data for the pre-training model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) and obtain feature representations of the text. Subsequently, external vectors representing the structural information of the data table are constructed based on the question's corresponding data table structure information. Finally, the external vectors are fused with the feature vectors produced by the pre-trained model to enhance feature extraction for different subtasks, ultimately improving the accuracy of SQL statement generation. The final results demonstrate that this method significantly enhances the accuracy of the generated SQL statements. Specifically, on the Table QA test set, 90.48% execution accuracy was achieved.\n",

      "Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) techniques play an increasingly important role in Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) translation. LLMs trained by extensive corpora have strong natural language understanding and basic SQL generation abilities without additional tuning specific to NL2SQL tasks. Existing LLMs-based NL2SQL approaches try to improve the translation by enhancing the LLMs with an emphasis on user intention understanding. However, LLMs sometimes fail to generate appropriate SQL due to their lack of knowledge in organizing complex logical operator composition. A promising method is to input the LLMs with demonstrations, which include known NL2SQL translations from various databases. LLMs can learn to organize operator compositions from the input demonstrations for the given task. In this paper, we propose PURPLE (Pre-trained models Utilized to Retrieve Prompts for Logical Enhancement), which improves accuracy by retrieving demonstrations containing the requisite logical operator composition for the NL2SQL task on hand, thereby guiding LLMs to produce better SQL translation. PURPLE achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 80.5% exact-set match accuracy and 87.8% execution match accuracy on the validation set of the popular NL2SQL benchmark Spider. PURPLE maintains high accuracy across diverse benchmarks, budgetary constraints, and various LLMs, showing robustness and cost-effectiveness.\n",

To make it easier and faster for users to obtain visual charts from data, natural language interfaces for data visualization have emerged. Users only need to provide the visualization model with the data to be visualized and a description of their visualization needs, and the model will return a visual chart(NL2VIS). In real-world scenarios, most data is stored in relational databases. To visualize this data, it is first necessary to generate a structured query statements based on the user’s visualization requirements(NL2SQL), and then proceed with the subsequent visualization operations. This study breaks down the task of automatic visualization of tabular data in relational databases into three main steps: generating SQL, determining the chart type, and mapping data to visual channels. We utilize the Chain-of-Thought(CoT) technique of generative large language models to address the task of automatic visualization of tabular data. Finally, we evaluated our approach on the nvBench dataset, and the results show that CoT-based automatic visualization of tabular data performs well.\n",

      "Abstract: With the increasing complexity of database query requirements, the technology of converting natural language query into SQL (NL2SQL) becomes particularly important. The tree model simulates the generation process of SQL statements by constructing a tree structure, and effectively handles complex queries such as multi-table joins, subqueries and aggregate functions. The system proposed in this study firstly pre-screens the database, and uses TF-IDF algorithm and cosine similarity calculation to determine the most relevant tables and fields. Then, the complex SQL statements are disassembled into multi-tree forms, and the tree structure is optimized through syntax analysis and tree pruning reconstruction. A tree model based on deep learning, namely Tree-LSTM, is adopted to predict the components of SQL. The experiment uses Chinese DuSQL data set, and the results show that the model achieves 85.6% accuracy and 84.0% F1 score on the whole data set, especially on complex queries. The advantage of tree model lies in its clear structure, powerful complex query processing ability and cross-domain adaptability. This study provides a new solution for the field of database query, lowers the threshold of database query and improves the efficiency of user query.\n",

      "Abstract: Tabular Representation Learning and Large Language Models have recently achieved promising results in solving the Semantic Parsing (SP) task. Given a question posed in natural language on a relational table, the goal is to return to the end-users executable SQL declarations. However, models struggle to produce the correct output when questions are ambiguously defined w.r.t. the table schema. Assessing the robustness to data-ambiguity can be particularly time-consuming as entails seeking ambiguous patterns on a large number of queries with varying complexity. To automate this process, we propose Data-Ambiguity Tester, a pipeline for data-ambiguity testing tailored to SP. It first automatically generates non-ambiguous natural language questions and SQL queries of varying complexity. Then, it injects ambiguous patterns, extracted from a human-annotated set of relational tables, in the natural language questions. Finally, it quantifies the level of ambiguity using customized performance metrics. Results show strengths and limitations of existing models in coping with ambiguity between questions and tabular data.\n",

      "Abstract: The current technological innovation is witnessing a substantial surge of interest focused on the creation of so-phisticated tools that facilitate natural language interfaces for databases. This emerging trend is driven by a compelling aim: to bridge the existing accessibility gap that separates the average user from the technical accessibility of traditional databases. A key requirement for achieving this goal is the conversion of everyday natural language queries into structured SQL, a step that transforms technical operations into user-friendly ones. Central to this pursuit is recognizing that natural language is the most intuitive and innate mode of human communication. By leveraging the capabilities of language models, this study effectively demonstrates the translation of natural language requests into structured SQL queries. Upon utilizing this model, the paper also showcases an interactive web application to demonstrate a use case of the system, paving the way to make databases more accessible, user-friendly, and impactful across a broader spectrum of users.\n",

      "Abstract: With the continuous development of computer technology, the Internet has entered the era of big data, which has spawned massive data in various fields and stored it in the database in a structured form. As an important national infrastructure, the power system is also constantly generating various types of data, and has become an important resource for daily operation and maintenance. During the interaction with the database, business personnel need to manually write SQL statements, which poses a challenge to a large number of nonprofessionals; At the same time, for experienced professionals, the conditions of SQL statements are complex and changeable, which is easy to make mistakes, thus affecting the utilization of data and the efficiency of queries. Therefore, how to fully explore the relationship between natural language and SQLstatements and apply them to power operation and maintenance is an important research topic. This paper studies the method of transforming natural language into SQL statement according to the current situation of power field. In terms of solution strategy, this paper divides the problem into several subproblems and combines BERT to carry out multi task learning. The experimental results show that this method is effective on Text2SQL tasks.\n",

      "Abstract: A Natural Language (NL) Interface to Databases (NLIDB) aims to help end-users access databases. State-of-the-art approaches primarily construct language translation models to convert NL queries to SQL queries. While these models exhibit good performance on NLIDB benchmarks, the translation accuracy seems to have stalled at between 70%-75%, and most erroneous translations happen with complex queries that require an understanding of the structure and semantics specific to a database. This paper proposes a Generate-And-Rank approach called Gar. Gar assumes that a set of sample SQL queries is given to represent the possible user-intended queries to the database. In order to provide a broad coverage, akin to avoiding over-fitting, Gar extracts the basic components from the sample set to form the basic building blocks to generate a set of generalized SQL queries. By leveraging a simple rule-based SQL to NL technique, a less natural NL expression called a dialect expression for each sample and generalized SQL query is obtained. Finally, a learning-to-rank method is used for a given NL query to retrieve the best dialect expression and hence the resulting SQL query. Extensive experiments are performed to study Gar in comparison with other approaches. The results show that Gar achieves better performance on the NLIDB benchmarks, including in particular a 78.5% translation accuracy on the popular Spider benchmark, outperforming the best reported accuracy in the literature. An extension to Gar, called Gar-j, is further introduced to aid the translation by annotating join semantics in the sample queries. The experimental results show that Gar-j can further improve translation accuracy on queries with joins. Code for Gar can be found at https://github.com/Kaimary/GAR.\n",

      "Abstract: The Natural Language Interface to Databases (NLIDB) empowers non-technical users with database access through intuitive natural language (NL) interactions. Advanced approaches, utilizing neural sequence-to-sequence models or large-scale language models, typically employ auto-regressive decoding to generate unique SQL queries sequentially. While these translation models have greatly improved the overall translation accuracy, surpassing 70% on NLIDB benchmarks, the use of auto-regressive decoding to generate single SQL queries may result in sub-optimal outputs, potentially leading to erroneous translations. In this paper, we propose Metasql, a unified generate-then-rank framework that can be flexibly incorporated with existing NLIDBs to consistently improve their translation accuracy. Metasql introduces query metadata to control the generation of better SQL query candidates and uses learning-to-rank algorithms to retrieve globally optimized queries. Specifically, Metasql first breaks down the meaning of the given NL query into a set of possible query metadata, representing the basic concepts of the semantics. These metadata are then used as language constraints to steer the underlying translation model toward generating a set of candidate SQL queries. Finally, Metasql ranks the candidates to identify the best matching one for the given NL query. Extensive experiments are performed to study Metasql on two public NLIDB benchmarks. The results show that the performance of the translation models can be effectively improved using Metasql. In particular, applying Metasql to the published Lgesql model obtains a translation accuracy of 77.4 % on the validation set and 72.3 % on the test set of the Spider benchmark, outperforming the baseline by 2.3% and 0.3%, respectively. Moreover, applying Metasql to GpT-4 achieves translation accuracies of 68.6%, 42.0%, and 17.6 % on the three real-world complex scientific databases of Sciencebenchmark, respectively.

The output of the model includes the connection relationships of the entity pairs and the SQL semantics of the entities in the entity pair. By predicting different entities in natural language problems, we get a weighted undirected graph that is highly consistent with the SQL grammar.

      "Abstract: Relational databases are among the most widely used architectures to store massive amounts of data in the modern world. However, there is a barrier between these databases and the average user. The user often lacks the knowledge of a query language such as SQL required to interact with the database. The NL2SQL task aims at finding deep learning approaches to solve this problem by converting natural language questions into valid SQL queries. Given the sensitive nature of some databases and the growing need for data privacy, we have presented an approach with data privacy at its core. We have passed RoBERTa embeddings and data-agnostic knowledge vectors into LSTM based submodels to predict the final query. Although we have not achieved state of the art results, we have eliminated the need for the table data, right from the training of the model, and have achieved a test set execution accuracy of 76.7%. By eliminating the table data dependency while training we have created a model capable of zero shot learning based on the natural language question and table schema alone.\n",

The main task of the natural language generating SQL query statement task is to convert the natural language into an executable SQL query statement. However, how to convert natural language into SQL queries has become a difficult task for this task. This research mainly uses the template-filled SQLNet model as the benchmark model to design a model from Chinese natural language to SQL query statements. At the same time, two modules, select num and where relation, are added to the Select clause and the where clause, respectively. At the same time, modify the condition value module in the where clause and then predict the condition value after adding the column type information. This Chinese NL2SQL deep learning model was experimentally verified on an open Chinese data set TableQA. The experimental results show that the model can effectively convert Chinese natural language into SQL query sentences.\n",

Although previous researches about Text2SQL have provided some workable solutions, most of them extract values based on column representation.

In this work, we propose a new neural network architecture based on the pre-trained BERT, called M-SQL. The column-based value extraction is divided into two modules, value extraction and value-column matching. We evaluate M-SQL on a more complicated TableQA dataset, which comes from an AI competition.

It is a long-term research issue and has recently received attention from the relevant communities. Although previous researches have provided some workable solutions, most of them only consider table schemas and natural language questions when parsing SQL queries, and do not use table contents. We observe that table contents can provide more helpful information for some user questions. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network approach, F-SQL, to focus on solving the problem of table content utilization. In particular, we employ the gate mechanism to fuse table schemas and table contents and get the more different representation about table schemas. We test this idea on the WikiSQL and TableQA datasets. Experimental results show that F-SQL achieves new state-of-the-art results on WikiSQL and TableQA.\n",

      "Abstract: Existing approaches to automatic data transformation are insufficient to meet the requirements in many real-world scenarios, such as the building sector. First, there is no convenient interface for domain experts to provide domain knowledge easily. Second, they require significant training data collection overheads. Third, the accuracy suffers from complicated schema changes. To address these shortcomings, we present a novel approach that leverages the unique capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in coding, complex reasoning, and zero-shot learning to generate SQL code that transforms the source datasets into the target datasets. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by designing an LLM-based framework, termed SQLMorpher, which comprises a prompt generator that integrates the initial prompt with optional domain knowledge and historical patterns in external databases. It also implements an iterative prompt optimization mechanism that automatically improves the prompt based on flaw detection. The key contributions of this work include (1) pioneering an end-to-end LLM-based solution for data transformation, (2) developing a benchmark dataset of 105 real-world building energy data transformation problems, and (3) conducting an extensive empirical evaluation where our approach achieved 96% accuracy in all 105 problems. SQLMorpher demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing LLMs in complex, domain-specific challenges, highlighting the potential of their potential to drive sustainable solutions.\n",

      "Abstract: This work describes the designing and development of an AI-driven SQL learning and teaching platform that could be used for automating SQL query generation, evaluation, and feedback. Based on NLP and AI methodologies, the proposed platform makes use of Ollama’s Llama 3 for schema extraction, question generation, and grading. For answer generation, a fine-tuned Llama 3 model on a variation of the spider dataset is used. MongoDB has been utilized for scalable data storage and React for an intuitive front-end interface. The platform enables an instructor to upload datasets and automatically generate SQL-based tests for students. Students are also given immediate feedback regarding their SQL queries, which otherwise is a labor-intensive task. The platform can also overcome challenges that traditional SQL education face, such as inconsistency in grading and delay in giving feedback, thereby offering personalized feedback, comprehensive performance reports, and engaging learners. Our solution would lighten the burden of teaching SQL by ensuring less effort from instructors while teaching their students dynamically, through the assessment of queries in a real-time setting. By automation in conjunction with the feature of real-time interactivity, this solution has been steered toward an effective and scalable learning experience for SQL by both educators and learners.\n",

To get these insights, the course instructors need real-time access to the database and also need to have relevant SQL knowledge to operate the database to retrieve the required data. The study explores ways to mitigate the difficulties of SQL by developing an application that takes natural language questions that the course instructors have and convert them into SQL queries using a sequence-to-sequence model that show them the data they asked for on a dashboard. The study found that there was a drastic reduction in the time it took for the users of the e-learning platform to get the data from the database without waiting for support from the database administrators. This in turn empowered the educators to study the data and get insights into the reception and working of the course and make suitable changes if necessary which might enhance the user experience for their students.\n",

      "Abstract: In order to assist person who doesn't know how to write SQL to access the data in a relation database, using a deep neural architecture to translate the natural language to SQL has recently been extensively studied. Previous work suffers from the complexity of where clause, since the number of conditions is totally random and predicting the value of condition is a sequence-to-sequence problem. We follow the slot filling idea, and introduce a model called TagNet. First of all, we innovatively propose a task attention mechanism. It takes the relativity of tasks into consideration for attention mechanism. Secondly, we use type embedding of each token of question and each column to enhance the representation for value prediction. Thirdly, in the task of predicting WHERE VALUE, we propose a tag decoder. It output a sequence of equal length compared with input. It consists of two tokens:<;QUE>, <;VAL>, indicating the corresponding token of input is whether or not a value token. We evaluate out model on WikiSQL, and compared to our baseline-SQLNet, we gain an absolute 7.6% increase on logic form accuracy and 6.3% increase on execution accuracy.\n",

Extracting information from relational databases by using language called structured query language (SQL) but the SQL has predefined structure and format, so it is difficult for the non-expert users to access information from databases. By using natural language to retrieve information from database is an easier way. The computers can't understand the natural language so they need an interface; that is the reason for developing a natural language interface to database. The natural language interface is capable for translating the natural language query given by the user into an equivalent one in Database Query Language. Thus natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDB) were developed for converting natural language to SQL query and get the corresponding result from the database. There are different surveys going over time i.e., how to use natural languages like Malayalam, English, Hindi, and Tamil etc. instead of SQL query.\n",

      "Abstract: The project introduces a new Natural Language to SQL Query Converter implemented using Lex and Yacc tools. We aim to bridge the separation between human-readable statements and machine-executable SQL queries. By leveraging Lex for tokenization and Yacc for parsing, the system expertly navigates the conversion process, precisely extracting vital components from input statements. The Lex and Yacc implementations rely heavily on precise grammar rules to convert natural language expressions into SQL queries seamlessly. By encapsulating the semantics of typical database interactions, these rules enable the system to interpret user intentions and translate them into a suitable format for database execution. We will be implementing three main components in this project. The first involves inserting new statements and updating existing statements as needed. And lastly, we will be displaying the requested information. This project will showcase the impressive capabilities of Lex and Yacc as they convert unstructured natural language into structured database queries that can be efficiently executed.\n",

      "Abstract: Recent studies have focused on using natural language (NL) to automatically retrieve useful data from database (DB) systems. As an important component of autonomous DB systems, the NL-to-SQL technique can assist DB administrators in writing high-quality SQL statements and make persons with no SQL background knowledge learn complex SQL languages. However, existing studies cannot deal with the issue that the expression of NL inevitably mismatches the implementation details of SQLs, and the large number of out-of-domain (OOD) words makes it difficult to predict table columns. In particular, it is difficult to accurately convert NL into SQL in an end-to-end fashion. Intuitively, it facilitates the model to understand the relations if a “bridge” [transition representation (TR)] is employed to make it compatible with both NL and SQL in the phase of conversion. In this article, we propose an automatic SQL generator with TR called GTR in cross-domain DB systems. Specifically, GTR contains three SQL generation steps: 1) GTR learns the relation between questions and DB schemas; 2) GTR uses a grammar-based model to synthesize a TR; and 3) GTR predicts SQL from TR based on the rules. We conduct extensive experiments on two commonly used datasets, that is, WikiSQL and Spider. On the testing set of the Spider and WikiSQL datasets, the results show that GTR achieves 58.32% and 71.29% exact matching accuracy which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, respectively.\n",

      "Abstract: The task of generating SQL queries from natural language questions has long been a challenge for researchers, particularly in the context of teaching and tutoring database students. Existing efforts have yielded limited success, especially when it comes to assessing student assignments automatically. The discrepancy arises from the fact that students’ query solutions may differ significantly from those of instructors, despite producing identical results. The conventional approach to determining query correctness relies on establishing query equivalence, yet a satisfactory algorithmic solution remains elusive due to the lack of a solid theoretical foundation.In this paper, we explore an alternative approach by harnessing the capabilities of ChatGPT, an advanced language model with extensive knowledge. We conduct experiments to investigate if this \"all-knowing\" system can provide valuable assistance in generating SQL queries. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate that ChatGPT offers significantly more encouraging and superior results compared to existing solutions found in the literature. This research presents a promising avenue for leveraging ChatGPT in the realm of teaching and assessing database students. By capitalizing on the model’s extensive knowledge and language processing abilities, we open up new possibilities for improving the accuracy and efficiency of SQL query generation from natural language. These results contribute to the advancement of educational methodologies and provide valuable insights for researchers and educators seeking innovative approaches to enhance database instruction and assessment.\n",
