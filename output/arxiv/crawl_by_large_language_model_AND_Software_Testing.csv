A particularly challenging class of this transpilation problem is translating between complex- (CISC) and reduced- (RISC) hardware architectures, due to fundamental differences in instruction complexity, memory models, and execution paradigms. In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained largelanguagemodels (LLMs) with the rigor of established softwaretesting constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks. We will open-source our codes, data, models, and benchmarks to establish a common foundation for ISA-level code translation research.","Submitted 17 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

Classic Search-Based SoftwareTesting (SBST) methods and concolic execution-based approaches for generating unit tests often fail to achieve high coverage due to difficulties in handling complex program units, such as branching conditions and external dependencies. Recent work has increasingly utilized largelanguagemodels (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the quality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in the model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in relatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents PALM, an approach that leverages largelanguagemodels (LLMs) to enhance the generation of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to identify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into path constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are used to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We implement the approach and evaluate it in 10 open-source Rust crates. Experimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can significantly improves test coverage compared to classic methods, with increases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its generated tests achieving an average coverage of 75.77%, comparable to human effort (71.30%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test generation. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of these submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending review. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program analysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated softwaretesting.","Submitted 10 June, 2025; v1 submitted 10 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

We introduce a hybrid framework called EvoGPT that integrates LLM-based test generation with evolutionary search techniques to create diverse, fault-revealing unit tests. Unit tests are initially generated with diverse temperature sampling to maximize behavioral and test suite diversity, followed by a generation-repair loop and coverage-guided assertion enhancement. The resulting test suites are evolved using genetic algorithms, guided by a fitness function prioritizing mutation score over traditional coverage metrics. This design emphasizes the primary objective of unit testing-fault detection. Evaluated on multiple open-source Java projects, EvoGPT achieves an average improvement of 10% in both code coverage and mutation score compared to LLMs and traditional search-based softwaretesting baselines. These results demonstrate that combining LLM-driven diversity, targeted repair, and evolutionary optimization produces more effective and resilient test suites.","Submitted 18 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

These models are increasingly being utilized for a range of SE tasks, including requirements engineering and design, code analysis and generation, software maintenance, and quality assurance. As LLMs become more integral to SE, evaluating their effectiveness is crucial for understanding their potential in this field. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made to assess LLM performance in various SE tasks, resulting in the creation of several benchmarks tailored to this purpose. This paper offers a thorough review of 291 benchmarks, addressing three main aspects: what benchmarks are available, how benchmarks are constructed, and the future outlook for these benchmarks. We begin by examining SE tasks such as requirements engineering and design, coding assistant, softwaretesting, AIOPs, software maintenance, and quality management. We then analyze the benchmarks and their development processes, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarks. Additionally, we discuss the successes and failures of LLMs in different software tasks and explore future opportunities and challenges for SE-related benchmarks.

However, its application often results in overly large test suites, as developers generate numerous tests to kill specific mutants, increasing computational overhead. This paper introduces PRIMG (Prioritization and Refinement Integrated Mutation-driven Generation), a novel framework for incremental and adaptive test case generation for Solidity smart contracts. PRIMG integrates two core components: a mutation prioritization module, which employs a machine learning model trained on mutant subsumption graphs to predict the usefulness of surviving mutants, and a test case generation module, which utilizes LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) to generate and iteratively refine test cases to achieve syntactic and behavioral correctness. We evaluated PRIMG on real-world Solidity projects from Code4Arena to assess its effectiveness in improving mutation scores and generating high-quality test cases. The experimental results demonstrate that PRIMG significantly reduces test suite size while maintaining high mutation coverage. The prioritization module consistently outperformed random mutant selection, enabling the generation of high-impact tests with reduced computational effort. Furthermore, the refining process enhanced the correctness and utility of LLM-generated tests, addressing their inherent limitations in handling edge cases and complex program logic.","Submitted 8 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

However, their rapid evolution poses a critical challenge for companies implementing DevSecOps - evaluations of their effectiveness quickly become outdated, making it difficult to assess their reliability for production use. While academic research has extensively studied LLM-based test generation, evaluations typically provide point-in-time analyses using academic benchmarks. Such evaluations do not address the practical needs of companies who must continuously assess tool reliability and integration with existing development practices. This work presents a measurement framework for the continuous evaluation of commercial LLM test generators in industrial environments. We demonstrate its effectiveness through a longitudinal study at LKS Next. The framework integrates with industry-standard tools like SonarQube and provides metrics that evaluate both technical adequacy (e.g., test coverage) and practical considerations (e.g., maintainability or expert assessment). Our methodology incorporates strategies for test case selection, prompt engineering, and measurement infrastructure, addressing challenges such as data leakage and reproducibility. Results highlight both the rapid evolution of LLM capabilities and critical factors for successful industrial adoption, offering practical guidance for companies seeking to integrate these technologies into their development pipelines.","Submitted 26 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

Despite their impressive adaptability, these models remain vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations and exhibit unpredictable behavior when faced with linguistic variations. Inspired by softwaretesting principles, we introduce a softwaretesting-inspired framework, called MMT4NL, for evaluating the trustworthiness of in-context learning by utilizing adversarial perturbations and softwaretesting techniques. It includes diverse evaluation aspects of linguistic capabilities for testing the ICL capabilities of LLMs. MMT4NL is built around the idea of crafting metamorphic adversarial examples from a test set in order to quantify and pinpoint bugs in the designed prompts of ICL. Our philosophy is to treat any LLM as software and validate its functionalities just like testing the software. Finally, we demonstrate applications of MMT4NL on the sentiment analysis and question-answering tasks.

We show that these concepts raise exciting new challenges in the context of LargeLanguageModels for softwaretest generation. More specifically, we formally define and investigate the properties of hardening and catching tests. A hardening test is one that seeks to protect against future regressions, while a catching test is one that catches such a regression or a fault in new functionality introduced by a code change. Hardening tests can be generated at any time and may become catching tests when a future regression is caught. We also define and motivate the Catching 'Just-in-Time' (JiTTest) Challenge, in which tests are generated 'just-in-time' to catch new faults before they land into production. We show that any solution to Catching JiTTest generation can also be repurposed to catch latent faults in legacy code. We enumerate possible outcomes for hardening and catching tests and JiTTests, and discuss open research problems, deployment options, and initial results from our work on automated LLM-based hardening at Meta.

Recent developments in LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) offer a potential alternative by powering Autonomous Web Agents (AWAs) that can autonomously interact with applications. These agents may serve as Autonomous Test Agents (ATAs), potentially reducing the need for maintenance-heavy automated scripts by utilising natural language instructions similar to those used by human testers. This paper investigates the feasibility of adapting AWAs for natural language test case execution and how to evaluate them. We contribute with (1) a benchmark of three offline web applications, and a suite of 113 manual test cases, split between passing and failing cases, to evaluate and compare ATAs performance, (2) SeeAct-ATA and pinATA, two open-source ATA implementations capable of executing test steps, verifying assertions and giving verdicts, and (3) comparative experiments using our benchmark that quantifies our ATAs effectiveness. Finally we also proceed to a qualitative evaluation to identify the limitations of PinATA, our best performing implementation. Our findings reveal that our simple implementation, SeeAct-ATA, does not perform well compared to our more advanced PinATA implementation when executing test cases (50% performance improvement). However, while PinATA obtains around 60% of correct verdict and up to a promising 94% specificity, we identify several limitations that need to be addressed to develop more resilient and reliable ATAs, paving the way for robust, low maintenance test automation.

Traditionally, formal verification techniques, such as model checking and theorem proving, have provided rigorous frameworks for detecting bugs and vulnerabilities.

Recently, the advent of LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) has introduced a new paradigm for software analysis, leveraging their ability to understand insecure coding practices.

To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs. As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical. However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy. Standard softwaretesting approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language. Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents. To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations. ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses. ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate. Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment.

Our methodology addresses existing challenges around usage of Generative AI techniques in automated softwaretesting by developing a structured format that enables LLMs to understand web application architecture through in-context learning.

However, because LLMs are trained on vast amounts of open-source code, they often generate test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may even contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics (RLSQM), wherein we utilize Reinforcement Learning to generate high-quality unit tests based on static analysis-based quality metrics. First, we analyzed LLM-generated tests and show that LLMs frequently do generate undesirable test smells -- up to 37% of the time. Then, we implemented lightweight static analysis-based reward model and trained LLMs using this reward model to optimize for five code quality metrics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the RL-optimized Codex model consistently generated higher-quality test cases than the base LLM, improving quality metrics by up to 23%, and generated nearly 100% syntactically-correct code. RLSQM also outperformed GPT-4 on all code quality metrics, in spite of training a substantially cheaper Codex model. We provide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation quality and show that RLSQM is a significant step towards enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of automated softwaretesting.

However, the openness of crowdsourced testing presents challenges, particularly in the manual review of numerous test reports, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Objective: The primary goal of this research is to improve the efficiency of review processes in crowdsourced testing. Traditional approaches to test report prioritization lack a deep understanding of semantic information in textual descriptions of these reports. This paper introduces LLMPrior, a novel approach for prioritizing crowdsourced test reports using largelanguagemodels (LLMs). Method: LLMPrior leverages LLMs for the analysis and clustering of crowdsourced test reports based on the types of bugs revealed in their textual descriptions. This involves using prompt engineering techniques to enhance the performance of LLMs. Following the clustering, a recurrent selection algorithm is applied to prioritize the reports. Results: Empirical experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMPrior. The findings indicate that LLMPrior not only surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of performance but also proves to be more feasible, efficient, and reliable.

However, effectiveness of testing critically depends on the quality of test suites used. Test cases in a test suite consist of two fundamental parts: (1) input values for the code under test, and (2) correct checks for the outputs it produces. These checks are commonly written as assertions, and termed test oracles. The last couple of decades have seen much progress in automated test input generation, e.g., using fuzzing and symbolic execution. However, automating test oracles remains a relatively less explored problem area. Indeed, a test oracle by its nature requires knowledge of expected behavior, which may only be known to the developer and may not not exist in a formal language that supports automated reasoning. Our focus in this paper is automation of test oracles for clients of widely used Java libraries, e.g., java.lang and java.util packages. Our key insight is that Javadocs that provide a rich source of information can enable automated generation of test oracles. Javadocs of the core Java libraries are fairly detailed documents that contain natural language descriptions of not only how the libraries behave but also how the clients must (not) use them. We use largelanguagemodels as an enabling technology to embody our insight into a framework for test oracle automation, and evaluate it experimentally. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate oracles for checking normal and exceptional behaviors from Javadocs, with 98.8% of these oracles being compilable and 96.4% accurately reflecting intended properties. Even for the few incorrect oracles, errors are minor and can be easily corrected with the help of additional comment information generated by the LLMs.","Submitted 14 December, 2024; v1 submitted 3 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024."

Typically, a unit test consists of a test prefix and a test oracle which captures the developer's intended behaviour. A known limitation of traditional test generation techniques (e.g. Randoop and Evosuite) is that they produce test oracles that capture the actual program behaviour rather than the expected one. Recent approaches leverage LargeLanguageModels (LLMs), trained on an enormous amount of data, to generate developer-like code and test cases. We investigate whether the LLM-generated test oracles capture the actual or expected software behaviour. We thus, conduct a controlled experiment to answer this question, by studying LLMs performance on two tasks, namely, test oracle classification and generation. The study includes developer-written and automatically generated test cases and oracles for 24 open-source Java repositories, and different well tested prompts. Our findings show that LLM-based test generation approaches are also prone on generating oracles that capture the actual program behaviour rather than the expected one. Moreover, LLMs are better at generating test oracles rather than classifying the correct ones, and can generate better test oracles when the code contains meaningful test or variable names.

However, an equally important quality metric is the presence of test smells design flaws or anti patterns in test code that hinder maintainability and readability. In this study, we explore the diffusion of test smells in LLM generated unit test suites and compare them to those found in human written ones. We analyze a benchmark of 20,500 LLM-generated test suites produced by four models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Mistral 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B) across five prompt engineering techniques, alongside a dataset of 780,144 human written test suites from 34,637 projects. Leveraging TsDetect, a state of the art tool capable of detecting 21 different types of test smells, we identify and analyze the prevalence and co-occurrence of various test smells in both human written and LLM-generated test suites. Our findings reveal new insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in test generation. First, regarding prevalence, we observe that LLMs frequently generate tests with common test smells, such as Magic Number Test and Assertion Roulette. Second, in terms of co occurrence, certain smells, like Long Test and Useless Test, tend to co occur in LLM-generated suites, influenced by specific prompt techniques. Third, we find that project complexity and LLM specific factors, including model size and context length, significantly affect the prevalence of test smells. Finally, the patterns of test smells in LLM-generated tests often mirror those in human-written tests, suggesting potential data leakage from training datasets.

Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm to repair erroneous test cases generated by LLMs. We evaluate CodeLlama-13b, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the TestBench, and our experimental results indicate that larger models demonstrate a greater ability to effectively utilize contextual information, thus generating higher-quality test cases. Smaller models may struggle with the noise introduced by the extensive information contained within the full context.

The first study involved using 2 closed-source and 6 open-source LLMs to generate verifications for manual test steps and evaluate their similarity to original verifications. The second study involved recruiting softwaretesting professionals to assess their perception and agreement with the generated verifications compared to the original ones. Results: The open-source models Mistral-7B and Phi-3-mini-4k demonstrated effectiveness and consistency comparable to closed-source models like Gemini-1.5-flash and GPT-3.5-turbo in generating manual test verifications. However, the agreement level among professional testers was slightly above 40%, indicating both promise and room for improvement.

Recently, LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) have been applied to various aspects of software development, including unit test generation. Although several empirical studies evaluating LLMs' capabilities in test code generation exist, they primarily focus on simple scenarios, such as the straightforward generation of unit tests for individual methods. These evaluations often involve independent and small-scale test units, providing a limited view of LLMs' performance in real-world software development scenarios.

However, traditional process modeling methods often require the participation of numerous experts, which is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, the exploration of a more efficient and cost-effective automated modeling method has emerged as a focal point in current research. This article explores a framework for automatically generating process models with multi-agent orchestration (MAO), aiming to enhance the efficiency of process modeling and offer valuable insights for domain experts. Our framework MAO leverages largelanguagemodels as the cornerstone for multi-agent, employing an innovative prompt strategy to ensure efficient collaboration among multi-agent. Specifically, 1) generation. The first phase of MAO is to generate a slightly rough process model from the text description; 2) refinement. The agents would continuously refine the initial process model through multiple rounds of dialogue; 3) reviewing. Largelanguagemodels are prone to hallucination phenomena among multi-turn dialogues, so the agents need to review and repair semantic hallucinations in process models; 4) testing.

Although research has explored automated test case generation, generating meaningful assert statements remains an ongoing challenge. While several studies have investigated assert statement generation in Java, limited work addresses this task in popular dynamically-typed programming languages like Python. In this paper, we introduce Chat-like execution-based Asserts Prediction (\tool), a novel LargeLanguageModel-based approach for generating meaningful assert statements for Python projects. \tool utilizes the persona, Chain-of-Thought, and one-shot learning techniques in the prompt design, and conducts rounds of communication with LLM and Python interpreter to generate meaningful assert statements. We also present a Python assert statement dataset mined from GitHub. Our evaluation demonstrates that \tool achieves 64.7\% accuracy for single assert statement generation and 62\% for overall assert statement generation, outperforming the existing approaches. We also analyze the mismatched assert statements, which may still share the same functionality and discuss the potential help \tool could offer to the automated Python unit test generation. The findings indicate that \tool has the potential to benefit the SE community through more practical usage scenarios.","Submitted 31 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

However, these complex visual and functional logic present new challenges to softwaretesting. Existing automated GUI testing methods, constrained by the lack of reliable testing oracles, are limited to detecting crash bugs with obvious abnormal signals. Consequently, many non-crash functional bugs, ranging from unexpected behaviors to logical errors, often evade detection by current techniques. While these non-crash functional bugs can exhibit visual cues that serve as potential testing oracles, they often entail a sequence of screenshots, and detecting them necessitates an understanding of the operational logic among GUI page transitions, which is challenging traditional techniques. Considering the remarkable performance of Multimodal LargeLanguageModels (MLLM) in visual and language understanding, this paper proposes Trident, a novel vision-driven, multi-agent collaborative automated GUI testing approach for detecting non-crash functional bugs. It comprises three agents: Explorer, Monitor, and Detector, to guide the exploration, oversee the testing progress, and spot issues. We also address several challenges, i.e., align visual and textual information for MLLM input, achieve functionality-oriented exploration, and infer test oracles for non-crash bugs, to enhance the performance of functionality bug detection. We evaluate Trident on 590 non-crash bugs and compare it with 12 baselines, it can achieve more than 14%-112% and 108%-147% boost in average recall and precision compared with the best baseline. The ablation study further proves the contribution of each module. Moreover, Trident identifies 43 new bugs on Google Play, of which 31 have been fixed.","Submitted 4 December, 2024; v1 submitted 3 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

Decision-making relies on a variety of information, including code, requirements specifications, and other software artifacts that are often unclear or exist solely in the developer's mind. To fill in the gaps left by unclear information, we often rely on assumptions, intuition, or previous experiences to make decisions. This paper explores the potential of LLM-based chatbots like Bard, Copilot, and ChatGPT, to support software testers in test decisions such as prioritizing test cases effectively. We investigate whether LLM-based chatbots and human testers share similar ""assumptions"" or intuition in prohibitive testing scenarios where exhaustive execution of test cases is often impractical. Preliminary results from a survey of 127 testers indicate a preference for diverse test scenarios, with a significant majority (96%) favoring dissimilar test sets. Interestingly, two out of four chatbots mirrored this preference, aligning with human intuition, while the others opted for similar test scenarios, chosen by only 3.9% of testers.

The question of how to generate high-utility mutations, to be used for testing purposes, forms a key challenge in mutation testing literature. LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) have shown great potential in code-related tasks but their utility in mutation testing remains unexplored. To this end, we systematically investigate the performance of LLMs in generating effective mutations w.r.t. to their usability, fault detection potential, and relationship with real bugs. In particular, we perform a large-scale empirical study involving six LLMs, including both state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models, and 851 real bugs on two Java benchmarks (i.e., 605 bugs from 12 projects of Defects4J 2.0 and 246 bugs of ConDefects). We find that compared to existing approaches, LLMs generate more diverse mutations that are behaviorally closer to real bugs, which leads to approximately 19% higher fault detection than current approaches (i.e., 93% vs. 74%). Nevertheless, the mutants generated by LLMs have worse compilability rate, useless mutation rate, and equivalent mutation rate than those generated by rule-based approaches. This paper also examines alternative prompt engineering strategies and identifies the root causes of uncompilable mutations, providing insights for researchers to further enhance the performance of LLMs in mutation testing.","Submitted 14 September, 2024; v1 submitted 14 June, 2024; originally announced June 2024."

To evaluate the reliability of VDL, a mainstream approach is softwaretesting, which requires diverse mutations over image semantics. The rapid development of multi-modal largelanguagemodels (MLLMs) has introduced revolutionary image mutation potentials through instruction-driven methods. Users can now freely describe desired mutations and let MLLMs generate the mutated images. Hence, parallel to largelanguagemodels' (LLMs) recent success in traditional software fuzzing, one may also expect MLLMs to be promising for VDL testing in terms of offering unified, diverse, and complex image mutations. However, the quality and applicability of MLLM-based mutations in VDL testing remain largely unexplored. We present the first study, aiming to assess MLLMs' adequacy from 1) the semantic validity of MLLM mutated images, 2) the alignment of MLLM mutated images with their text instructions (prompts), and 3) the faithfulness of how different mutations preserve semantics that are ought to remain unchanged. With large-scale human studies and quantitative evaluations, we identify MLLM's promising potentials in expanding the covered semantics of image mutations. Notably, while SoTA MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4V) fail to support or perform worse in editing existing semantics in images (as in traditional mutations like rotation), they generate high-quality test inputs using ""semantic-replacement"" mutations (e.g., ""dress a dog with clothes""), which bring extra semantics to images; these were infeasible for past approaches. Hence, we view MLLM-based mutations as a vital complement to traditional mutations, and advocate future VDL testing tasks to combine MLLM-based methods and traditional image mutations for comprehensive and reliable testing.","Submitted 21 December, 2024; v1 submitted 22 April, 2024; originally announced April 2024."

While the recent advances in Search-Based SoftwareTesting (SBST) and LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) have shown promise in generating useful tests, these techniques still struggle to cover certain branches. Reaching these hard-to-cover branches usually requires constructing complex objects and resolving intricate inter-procedural dependencies in branch conditions, which poses significant challenges for existing test generation techniques.

Its key insight lies in extracting real usage scenarios of the target method under test to learn how to construct complex objects and extracting methods entailing inter-procedural dependencies with hard-to-cover branches to learn the semantics of branch constraints. To enhance efficiency and effectiveness, TELPA identifies a set of ineffective tests as counter-examples for LLMs and employs a feedback-based process to iteratively refine these counter-examples. Then, TELPA integrates program analysis results and counter-examples into the prompt, guiding LLMs to gain deeper understandings of the semantics of the target method and generate diverse tests that can reach the hard-to-cover branches.

The study revealed the prevalence of older BusyBox versions in real-world embedded products, prompting us to conduct fuzz testing on BusyBox. Fuzzing, a pivotal softwaretesting method, aims to induce crashes that are subsequently scrutinized to uncover vulnerabilities.

Our study showed a substantial increase in crashes when using LLM-generated initial seeds, highlighting the potential of LLM to efficiently tackle the typically labor-intensive task of generating target-specific initial seeds. The second technique involves repurposing previously acquired crash data from similar fuzzed targets before initiating fuzzing on a new target. This approach streamlines the time-consuming fuzz testing process by providing crash data directly to the new target before commencing fuzzing.

Given the complexity and diversity of real-world inputs, studying the robustness of LLMbased software in handling comprehensive inputs (including prompts and examples) is crucial for a thorough understanding of its performance. To this end, this paper introduces RITFIS, a Robust Input Testing Framework for LLM-based Intelligent Software. To our knowledge, RITFIS is the first framework designed to assess the robustness of LLM-based intelligent software against natural language inputs.

In this context, rather than relying on existing data, we conducted a cross-sectional survey and collected data within real working contexts, specifically, engaging with practitioners in industrial settings. We applied quantitative and qualitative techniques to analyze and synthesize our collected data. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs effectively enhance testing documents and significantly assist testing professionals in programming tasks like debugging and test case automation. LLMs can support individuals engaged in manual testing who need to code. However, it is crucial to emphasize that, at this early stage, softwaretesting professionals should use LLMs with caution while well-defined methods and guidelines are being built for the secure adoption of these tools.","Submitted 8 December, 2023; originally announced December 2023."

Ouédraogo, Jacques Klein, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé","Softwaretesting is a core discipline in software engineering where a large array of research results has been produced, notably in the area of automatic test generation. Because existing approaches produce test cases that either can be qualified as simple (e.g. unit tests) or that require precise specifications, most testing procedures still rely on test cases written by humans to form test suites. Such test suites, however, are incomplete: they only cover parts of the project or they are produced after the bug is fixed. Yet, several research challenges, such as automatic program repair, and practitioner processes, build on the assumption that available test suites are sufficient. There is thus a need to break existing barriers in automatic test case generation. While prior work largely focused on random unit testing inputs, we propose to consider generating test cases that realistically represent complex user execution scenarios, which reveal buggy behaviour. Such scenarios are informally described in bug reports, which should therefore be considered as natural inputs for specifying bug-triggering test cases. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of performing this generation by leveraging largelanguagemodels (LLMs) and using bug reports as inputs. Our experiments include the use of ChatGPT, as an online service, as well as CodeGPT, a code-related pre-trained LLM that was fine-tuned for our task. Overall, we experimentally show that bug reports associated to up to 50% of Defects4J bugs can prompt ChatGPT to generate an executable test case. We show that even new bug reports can indeed be used as input for generating executable test cases. Finally, we report experimental results which confirm that LLM-generated test cases are immediately useful in software engineering tasks such as fault localization as well as patch validation in automated program repair.","Submitted 10 October, 2023; originally announced October 2023."

Recently, LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) have gained popularity for code generation, including the automated creation of test cases. However, these LLMs are often trained on vast amounts of publicly available code, which may include test cases that do not adhere to best practices and may even contain test smells (anti-patterns). To address this issue, we propose a novel technique called Reinforcement Learning from Static Quality Metrics (RLSQM). To begin, we analyze the anti-patterns generated by the LLM and show that LLMs can generate undesirable test smells. Thus, we train specific reward models for each static quality metric, then utilize Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train models for optimizing a single quality metric at a time. Furthermore, we amalgamate these rewards into a unified reward model aimed at capturing different best practices and quality aspects of tests. By comparing RL-trained models with those trained using supervised learning, we provide insights into how reliably utilize RL to improve test generation quality and into the effects of various training strategies. Our experimental results demonstrate that the RL-optimized model consistently generated high-quality test cases compared to the base LLM, improving the model by up to 21%, and successfully generates nearly 100% syntactically correct code. RLSQM also outperformed GPT-4 on four out of seven metrics. This represents a significant step towards enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of softwaretesting through Reinforcement Learning and static quality metrics.

Test script generation is a vital component of softwaretesting, enabling efficient and reliable automation of repetitive test tasks. However, existing generation approaches often encounter limitations, such as difficulties in accurately capturing and reproducing test scripts across diverse devices, platforms, and applications. These challenges arise due to differences in screen sizes, input modalities, platform behaviors, API inconsistencies, and application architectures. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for achieving robust and comprehensive test automation. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, we aim to address these challenges and explore its potential as a versatile tool for test automation. We investigate how well LLMs can adapt to diverse devices and systems while accurately capturing and generating test scripts. Additionally, we evaluate its cross-platform generation capabilities by assessing its ability to handle operating system variations and platform-specific behaviors. Furthermore, we explore the application of LLMs in cross-app migration, where it generates test scripts across different applications and software environments based on existing scripts. Throughout the investigation, we analyze its adaptability to various user interfaces, app architectures, and interaction patterns, ensuring accurate script generation and compatibility. The findings of this research contribute to the understanding of LLMs' capabilities in test automation.

Desmarais","One of the critical phases in software development is softwaretesting. Testing helps with identifying potential bugs and reducing maintenance costs. The goal of automated test generation tools is to ease the development of tests by suggesting efficient bug-revealing tests. Recently, researchers have leveraged LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) of code to generate unit tests. While the code coverage of generated tests was usually assessed, the literature has acknowledged that the coverage is weakly correlated with the efficiency of tests in bug detection. To improve over this limitation, in this paper, we introduce MuTAP for improving the effectiveness of test cases generated by LLMs in terms of revealing bugs by leveraging mutation testing. Our goal is achieved by augmenting prompts with surviving mutants, as those mutants highlight the limitations of test cases in detecting bugs. MuTAP is capable of generating effective test cases in the absence of natural language descriptions of the Program Under Test (PUTs). We employ different LLMs within MuTAP and evaluate their performance on different benchmarks. Our results show that our proposed method is able to detect up to 28% more faulty human-written code snippets. Among these, 17% remained undetected by both the current state-of-the-art fully automated test generation tool (i.e., Pynguin) and zero-shot/few-shot learning approaches on LLMs. Furthermore, MuTAP achieves a Mutation Score (MS) of 93.57% on synthetic buggy code, outperforming all other approaches in our evaluation. Our findings suggest that although LLMs can serve as a useful tool to generate test cases, they require specific post-processing steps to enhance the effectiveness of the generated test cases which may suffer from syntactic or functional errors and may be ineffective in detecting certain types of bugs and testing corner cases PUTs.","Submitted 31 August, 2023; originally announced August 2023."

Pain points in writing property-based tests include implementing diverse random input generators and thinking of meaningful properties to test. Developers, however, are more amenable to writing documentation; plenty of library API documentation is available and can be used as natural language specifications for PBTs. As largelanguagemodels (LLMs) have recently shown promise in a variety of coding tasks, we investigate using modern LLMs to automatically synthesize PBTs using two prompting techniques. A key challenge is to rigorously evaluate the LLM-synthesized PBTs. We propose a methodology to do so considering several properties of the generated tests: (1) validity, (2) soundness, and (3) property coverage, a novel metric that measures the ability of the PBT to detect property violations through generation of property mutants. In our evaluation on 40 Python library API methods across three models (GPT-4, Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3-Opus), we find that with the best model and prompting approach, a valid and sound PBT can be synthesized in 2.4 samples on average. We additionally find that our metric for determining soundness of a PBT is aligned with human judgment of property assertions, achieving a precision of 100% and recall of 97%. Finally, we evaluate the property coverage of LLMs across all API methods and find that the best model (GPT-4) is able to automatically synthesize correct PBTs for 21% of properties extractable from API documentation.","Submitted 21 July, 2024; v1 submitted 10 July, 2023; originally announced July 2023."

Recent discoveries of the capabilities of largelanguagemodels (LLMs) suggest that they can be used as automated testing assistants, and thus provide helpful information and even drive the testing process. To highlight the potential of this technology, we present a taxonomy of LLM-based testing agents based on their level of autonomy, and describe how a greater level of autonomy can benefit developers in practice. An example use of LLMs as a testing assistant is provided to demonstrate how a conversational framework for testing can help developers. This also highlights how the often criticized hallucination of LLMs can be beneficial for testing.

Nevertheless, LLM-based tools encounter limitations in generating accurate unit tests. This paper presents ChatUniTest, an LLM-based automated unit test generation framework.

Ghaleb, Lionel Briand","Test suites tend to grow when software evolves, making it often infeasible to execute all test cases with the allocated testing budgets, especially for large software systems. Test suite minimization (TSM) is employed to improve the efficiency of softwaretesting by removing redundant test cases, thus reducing testing time and resources, while maintaining the fault detection capability of the test suite. Most existing TSM approaches rely on code coverage (white-box) or model-based features, which are not always available to test engineers. Recent TSM approaches that rely only on test code (black-box) have been proposed, such as ATM and FAST-R. To address the scalability, we propose LTM (Language model-based Test suite Minimization), a novel, scalable, and black-box similarity-based TSM approach based on largelanguagemodels (LLMs), which is the first application of LLMs in the context of TSM. To support similarity measurement for test code embeddings, we investigate five pre-trained language models: CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UniXcoder, StarEncoder, and CodeLlama, on which we compute two similarity measures: Cosine Similarity and Euclidean Distance. Our goal is to find similarity measures that are not only computationally more efficient but can also better guide a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search for optimal minimized test suites, thus reducing the overall search time. Experimental results show that the best configuration of LTM (UniXcoder/Cosine) outperforms ATM in three aspects: (a) achieving a slightly greater saving rate of testing time (41.72% versus 41.02%, on average); (b) attaining a significantly higher fault detection rate (0.84 versus 0.81, on average); and, most importantly, (c) minimizing test suites nearly five times faster on average, with higher gains for larger test suites and systems, thus achieving much higher scalability.","Submitted 30 September, 2024; v1 submitted 3 April, 2023; originally announced April 2023."

LaToza, Kevin Moran, Wing Lam","Over the past decade, predictive language modeling for code has proven to be a valuable tool for enabling new forms of automation for developers. More recently, we have seen the advent of general purpose ""largelanguagemodels"", based on neural transformer architectures, that have been trained on massive datasets of human written text spanning code and natural language. However, despite the demonstrated representational power of such models, interacting with them has historically been constrained to specific task settings, limiting their general applicability. Many of these limitations were recently overcome with the introduction of ChatGPT, a language model created by OpenAI and trained to operate as a conversational agent, enabling it to answer questions and respond to a wide variety of commands from end users. The introduction of models, such as ChatGPT, has already spurred fervent discussion from educators, ranging from fear that students could use these AI tools to circumvent learning, to excitement about the new types of learning opportunities that they might unlock. However, given the nascent nature of these tools, we currently lack fundamental knowledge related to how well they perform in different educational settings, and the potential promise (or danger) that they might pose to traditional forms of instruction. As such, in this paper, we examine how well ChatGPT performs when tasked with answering common questions in a popular softwaretesting curriculum. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT can provide correct or partially correct answers in 55.6% of cases, provide correct or partially correct explanations of answers in 53.0% of cases, and that prompting the tool in a shared question context leads to a marginally higher rate of correct responses. Based on these findings, we discuss the potential promises and perils related to the use of ChatGPT by students and instructors.","Submitted 11 March, 2023; v1 submitted 7 February, 2023; originally announced February 2023."
