Despite significant advances in mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that allow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like football games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational efficiency while enhancing behavioral realism. MobiVerse bridges the gap in mobility simulation by providing a customizable platform for mobility systems planning and operations with benchmark algorithms.

Our analysis shows that the memory-bound LLM decode phase dominates energy use, and yet most existing works focus on accelerating the prefill phase, neglecting energy concerns. We introduce Adaptive Energy-Centric Core Selection (AECS) and integrate it into MNN to create the energy-efficient version, MNN-AECS, the first engine-level system solution without requiring root access or OS modifications for energy-efficient LLM decoding. MNN-AECS is designed to reduce LLM decoding energy while keeping decode speed within an acceptable slowdown threshold by dynamically selecting low-power CPU cores. MNN-AECS is evaluated across 5 Android and 2 iOS devices on 5 popular LLMs of various sizes. Compared to original MNN, MNN-AECS cuts down energy use by 23% without slowdown averaged over all 7 devices and 4 datasets. Against other engines, including llama.cpp, executorch, mllm, and MediaPipe, MNN-AECS delivers 39% to 78% energy saving and 12% to 363% speedup on average.","Submitted 24 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

Tackling this challenge holds the potential to elevate mobile user experiences, notably through interactive and AR/VR applications. Current approaches aim to achieve this either using pre-recorded video responses or requiring multi-view images as input. In this paper, we present PhysID, that streamlines the creation of physics-based interactive dynamics from a single-view image by leveraging large generative models for 3D mesh generation and physical property prediction. This significantly reduces the expertise required for engineering-intensive tasks like 3D modeling and intrinsic property calibration, enabling the process to be scaled with minimal manual intervention. We integrate an on-device physics-based engine for physically plausible real-time rendering with user interactions.

However, automating these interactive features for testing is fraught with challenges, owing to their inherent need for timely, dynamic, and collaborative user interactions, which current automated testing methods inadequately address. Inspired by the concept of agents designed to autonomously and collaboratively tackle problems, we propose MAdroid, a novel multi-agent approach powered by the LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) to automate the multi-user interactive task for app feature testing. Specifically, MAdroid employs two functional types of multi-agents: user agents (Operator) and supervisor agents (Coordinator and Observer). Each agent takes a specific role: the Coordinator directs the interactive task; the Operator mimics user interactions on the device; and the Observer monitors and reviews the task automation process. Our evaluation, which included 41 multi-user interactive tasks, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 82.9% of the tasks with 96.8% action similarity, outperforming the ablation studies and state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a preliminary investigation underscores MAdroid's practicality by helping identify 11 multi-user interactive bugs during regression app testing, confirming its potential value in real-world software development contexts.","Submitted 23 June, 2025; v1 submitted 20 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

To satisfy low-latency and high-computation demands, the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) systems plays a vital role, which offloads computing tasks from terminal devices to nearby UAVs, enabling flexible and resilient service provisions for ground users. To promote the development of LAENets, it is significant to achieve low-carbon multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks. However, several challenges hinder this implementation, including the complexity of multi-dimensional UAV modeling and the difficulty of multi-objective coupled optimization. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LargeLanguageModel (LLM) agent framework for model formulation. Specifically, we develop HybridRAG by combining KeywordRAG, VectorRAG, and GraphRAG, empowering LLM agents to efficiently retrieve structural information from expert databases and generate more accurate optimization problems compared with traditional RAG-based LLM agents. After customizing carbon emission optimization problems for multi-UAV-assisted MEC networks, we propose a Double Regularization Diffusion-enhanced Soft Actor-Critic (R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC) algorithm to solve the formulated multi-objective optimization problem. The R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm incorporates diffusion entropy regularization and action entropy regularization to improve the performance of the diffusion policy. Furthermore, we dynamically mask unimportant neurons in the actor network to reduce the carbon emissions associated with model training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed HybridRAG-based LLM agent framework and the R\textsuperscript{2}DSAC algorithm.","Submitted 18 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

However, the sheer volume of reviews available on app stores can lead to information overload, thus impeding users' ability to make informed app selection decisions. To address this challenge, we leverage LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) to summarize mobile app reviews. In particular, we use the Chain of Density (CoD) prompt to guide OpenAI GPT-4 to generate abstractive, semantically dense, and easily interpretable summaries of mobile app reviews. The CoD prompt is engineered to iteratively extract salient entities from the source text and fuse them into a fixed-length summary. We evaluate the performance of our approach using a large dataset of mobile app reviews. We further conduct an empirical evaluation with 48 study participants to assess the readability of the generated summaries. Our results demonstrate that adapting the CoD prompt to focus on app features improves its ability to extract key themes from user reviews and generate natural language summaries tailored for end-user consumption. The prompt also manages to maintain the readability of the generated summaries while increasing their semantic density. Our work in this paper aims to improve mobile app users' experience by providing an effective mechanism for summarizing important user feedback in the review stream.","Submitted 17 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

LLMs pre-trained on general corpora often hallucinate when handling personalized or unseen queries, leading to incorrect or outdated responses. Knowledge editing addresses this by identifying and adjusting a small crucial portion of model weights, without compromising the general knowledge. However, prior knowledge editing methods are impractical to run on local devices due to the resource-heavy backpropagation (BP) needed for updates. We present MobiEdit, the first mobile knowledge editing framework that enables efficient LLM personalization on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices. MobiEdit replaces full-precision BP with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, thus compatible with the energy-efficient mobile neural processing units (NPUs). MobiEdit replaces full-precision backpropagation with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, making it compatible with energy-efficient mobile NPUs. To further improve gradient estimation efficiency, we introduce two optimizations: an early stoping mechanism that adaptively terminates editing upon success and a prefix cache that reuses computation across steps.

Mandic","Small Language Models (SLMs, or on-device LMs) have significantly fewer parameters than LargeLanguageModels (LLMs). They are typically deployed on low-end devices, like mobile phones and single-board computers. Unlike LLMs, which rely on increasing model size for better generalisation, SLMs designed for edge applications are expected to have adaptivity to the deployment environments and energy efficiency given the device battery life constraints, which are not addressed in datacenter-deployed LLMs. This paper addresses these two requirements by proposing a training-free token embedding compression approach using Tensor-Train Decomposition (TTD). Each pre-trained token embedding vector is converted into a lower-dimensional Matrix Product State (MPS). We comprehensively evaluate the extracted low-rank structures across compression ratio, language task performance, latency, and energy consumption on a typical low-end device, i.e. Raspberry Pi. Taking the sub-billion parameter versions of GPT-2/Cerebres-GPT and OPT models as examples, our approach achieves a comparable language task performance to the original model with around 2.0\times

The abundance of online user feedback warrants the automated identification of quality characteristics, but the online user feedback's heterogeneity and the lack of appropriate training corpora limit the applicability of supervised machine learning. We therefore investigate the viability of three approaches that could be effective in low-data settings: language patterns (LPs) based on quality-related keywords, instructions for crowdsourced micro-tasks, and largelanguagemodel (LLM) prompts. We determined the feasibility of each approach and then compared their accuracy. For the complex multiclass classification of quality characteristics, the LP-based approach achieved a varied precision (0.38-0.92) depending on the quality characteristic, and low recall; crowdsourcing achieved the best average accuracy in two consecutive phases (0.63, 0.72), which could be matched by the best-performing LLM condition (0.66) and a prediction based on the LLMs' majority vote (0.68). Our findings show that in this low-data setting, the two approaches that use crowdsourcing or LLMs instead of involving experts achieve accurate classifications, while the LP-based approach has only limited potential.

In this work, we present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with 894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and systematically evaluates largelanguagemodels (LLMs) and prompting strategies.

Our pipeline enables scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes: positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g., scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained, co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis.

However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment mapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional modality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal spatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained multimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these maps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our maps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to audio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When combined with largelanguagemodels (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural language commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., ""in between the sofa and TV"") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across different robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand. Building upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a unified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues through the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models. This enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or audio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the incorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal disambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps enable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by 50% in ambiguous scenarios. These capabilities extend to mobile robots and tabletop manipulators, supporting navigation and interaction guided by visual, audio, and spatial cues.","Submitted 7 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

While traditional engineering methods have made progress, the complexity and dynamism of real-world traffic necessitate more advanced analytical frameworks. LargeLanguageModels (LLMs), with their unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding, knowledge integration, and reasoning, represent a promising paradigm shift. This paper comprehensively reviews the application and customization of LLMs for enhancing roadway safety and mobility. A key focus is how LLMs are adapted -- via architectural, training, prompting, and multimodal strategies -- to bridge the ""modality gap"" with transportation's unique spatio-temporal and physical data. The review systematically analyzes diverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal control) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,). Enabling technologies such as V2X integration, domain-specific foundation models, explainability frameworks, and edge computing are also examined. Despite significant potential, challenges persist regarding inherent LLM limitations (hallucinations, reasoning deficits), data governance (privacy, bias), deployment complexities (sim-to-real, latency), and rigorous safety assurance. Promising future research directions are highlighted, including advanced multimodal fusion, enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning, human-AI collaboration, continuous learning, and the development of efficient, verifiable systems.

This task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and correctness of actions.

Its agility and ability to optimize mobility and establish Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication make it increasingly vital for managing emergencies such as disaster response, search and rescue, and wildfire monitoring. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to optimize UAV navigation and control, its high training complexity, low sample efficiency, and simulation-to-reality gap limit its practicality in public safety. Recent advances in LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation via natural language prompts and example-based guidance, without retraining. Deploying LLMs at the network edge, rather than in the cloud, further reduces latency and preserves data privacy, thereby making them suitable for real-time, mission-critical public safety UAVs. This paper proposes the integration of LLM-enabled ICL with public safety UAV to address the key functions, such as path planning and velocity control, in the context of emergency response. We present a case study on data collection scheduling where the LLM-enabled ICL framework can significantly reduce packet loss compared to conventional approaches, while also mitigating potential jailbreaking vulnerabilities.

Speculative decoding inherently relies on sacrificing extra memory allocations to generate several candidate tokens, of which acceptance rate drives the speedup. However, deploying speculative decoding on memory-constrained devices, such as mobile GPUs, remains as a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a device-aware inference engine named SpecMemo that can smartly control memory allocations at finer levels to enable multi-turn chatbots with speculative decoding on such limited memory devices. Our methodology stems from theoretically modeling memory footprint of speculative decoding to determine a lower bound on the required memory budget while retaining speedup. SpecMemo empirically acquires a careful balance between minimizing redundant memory allocations for rejected candidate tokens and maintaining competitive performance gains from speculation. Notably, with SpecMemo's memory management, we maintain 96% of overall throughput from speculative decoding on MT-Bench, with reduced generation-memory by 65% on single Nvidia Titan RTX. Given multiple constrained GPUs, we build on top of previous speculative decoding architectures to facilitate big-model inference by distributing Llama-2-70B-Chat model, on which we provide novel batched speculative decoding to increase usability of multiple small server GPUs.

While personalized decision systems are often modeled using bandit formulations, the integration of GenAI introduces new structure into otherwise classical sequential learning problems. In GenAI-powered interventions, the agent selects a query, but the environment experiences a stochastic response drawn from the generative model. Standard bandit methods do not explicitly account for this structure, where actions influence rewards only through stochastic, observed treatments. We introduce generator-mediated bandit-Thompson sampling (GAMBITTS), a bandit approach designed for this action/treatment split, using mobile health interventions with largelanguagemodel-generated text as a motivating case study. GAMBITTS explicitly models both the treatment and reward generation processes, using information in the delivered treatment to accelerate policy learning relative to standard methods. We establish regret bounds for GAMBITTS by decomposing sources of uncertainty in treatment and reward, identifying conditions where it achieves stronger guarantees than standard bandit approaches. In simulation studies, GAMBITTS consistently outperforms conventional algorithms by leveraging observed treatments to more accurately estimate expected rewards.","Submitted 22 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Classical approaches often depend on strong parametric assumptions or manual structural design and struggle in high-dimensional or heterogeneous domains. Recent progress in LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) reveals their potential as flexible, high-dimensional priors over real-world distributions. However, when applied to data synthesis, standard LLM-based sampling is inefficient, constrained by fixed context limits, and fails to ensure statistical alignment. Given this, we introduce LLMSynthor, a general framework for data synthesis that transforms LLMs into structure-aware simulators guided by distributional feedback. LLMSynthor treats the LLM as a nonparametric copula simulator for modeling high-order dependencies and introduces LLM Proposal Sampling to generate grounded proposal distributions that improve sampling efficiency without requiring rejection. By minimizing discrepancies in the summary statistics space, the iterative synthesis loop aligns real and synthetic data while gradually uncovering and refining the latent generative structure. We evaluate LLMSynthor in both controlled and real-world settings using heterogeneous datasets in privacy-sensitive domains (e.g., e-commerce, population, and mobility) that encompass both structured and unstructured formats. The synthetic data produced by LLMSynthor shows high statistical fidelity, practical utility, and cross-data adaptability, positioning it as a valuable tool across economics, social science, urban studies, and beyond.","Submitted 20 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Bug reproduction, a key aspect of maintaining app quality, often faces significant challenges. Specifically, when descriptions in bug reports are ambiguous or difficult to comprehend, current approaches fail to extract accurate information. Moreover, modern applications exhibit inherent complexity with multiple pages and diverse functionalities, making it challenging for existing methods to map the relevant information in bug reports to the corresponding UI elements that need to be manipulated. To address these challenges, we propose BugRepro, a novel technique that integrates domain-specific knowledge to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of bug reproduction. BugRepro adopts a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. It retrieves similar bug reports along with their corresponding steps to reproduce (S2R) entities from an example-rich RAG document. In addition, BugRepro explores the graphical user interface (GUI) of the app and extracts transition graphs from the user interface to incorporate app-specific knowledge to guide largelanguagemodels (LLMs) in their exploration process. Our experiments demonstrate that BugRepro significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art methods (ReCDroid and AdbGPT).

However, due to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers, such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic, with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%.

Multi-tier networks with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and high-altitude platforms (HAPs) offer promising solutions, but face challenges from high mobility and dynamic channel conditions that cause unstable connections and frequent handovers. In this paper, we design a three-tier network architecture that integrates LEO satellites, HAPs, and ground terminals with hybrid free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) links to maximize coverage while maintaining connectivity reliability. This hybrid approach leverages the high bandwidth of FSO for satellite-to-HAP links and the weather resilience of RF for HAP-to-ground links.

S. Quek","Recently emerged 6G space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), which integrate satellites, aerial networks, and terrestrial communications, offer ubiquitous coverage for various mobile applications. However, the highly dynamic, open, and heterogeneous nature of SAGINs poses severe security issues. Forming a defense line of SAGINs suffers from two preliminary challenges: 1) accurately understanding massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat information to generate defense strategies against various malicious attacks, 2) rapidly adapting to potential unknown threats to yield more effective security strategies. To tackle the above two challenges, we propose a novel security framework for SAGINs based on LargeLanguageModels (LLMs), which consists of two key ingredients LLM-6GNG and 6G-INST. Our proposed LLM-6GNG leverages refined chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and dynamic multi-agent mechanisms to analyze massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat data and generate comprehensive security strategies, thus addressing the first challenge. Our proposed 6G-INST relies on a novel self-evolving method to automatically update LLM-6GNG, enabling it to accommodate unknown threats under dynamic communication environments, thereby addressing the second challenge. Additionally, we prototype the proposed framework with ns-3, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and software-defined radio (SDR). Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that our framework produces highly accurate security strategies that remain robust against a variety of unknown attacks. We will release our code to contribute to the community.","Submitted 7 May, 2025; v1 submitted 6 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Existing centralized IoV solutions often suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive environments. Meanwhile, integrating LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) in vehicular systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management.

Driven by LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents hold the potential to empower the creation, maintenance, and evolution of mobile metaverses. Currently, AI agents are primarily constructed using cloud-based LLMs and VLMs. However, several challenges hinder their effective implementation, including high service latency and potential sensitive data leakage during perception and processing. In this paper, we develop an edge-cloud collaboration-based federated AI agent construction framework in mobile metaverses. Specifically, Edge Servers (ESs), acting as agent infrastructures, collaboratively create agent modules in a distributed manner. The cloud server then integrates these modules into AI agents and deploys them at the edge, thereby enabling low-latency AI agent services for users. Considering that ESs may exhibit dynamic levels of willingness to participate in federated AI agent construction, we design a two-period dynamic contract model to continuously motivate ESs to participate in agent module creation, effectively addressing the dynamic information asymmetry between the cloud server and the ESs.

To address these issues, we propose Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), a benchmark that requires agents to interpret user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space.

To address these limitations, we present the Instruction-Augmented Long-Horizon Planning (IALP) system, a novel framework that employs LLMs to generate feasible and optimal actions based on real-time sensor feedback, including grounded knowledge of the environment, in a closed-loop interaction. Distinct from prior works, our approach augments user instructions into PDDL problems by leveraging both the abstract reasoning capabilities of LLMs and grounding mechanisms. By conducting various real-world long-horizon tasks, each consisting of seven distinct manipulatory skills, our results demonstrate that the IALP system can efficiently solve these tasks with an average success rate exceeding 80%.

With the recent advancements in LargeLanguageModels (LLMs), which have been widely applied to text-based planning and complex reasoning, their potential for enhancing autonomous exploration is becoming increasingly promising. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM-based human-preferred exploration framework that seamlessly integrates a mobile robot system with LLMs. By leveraging the reasoning and adaptability of LLMs, our approach enables intuitive and flexible preference control through natural language while maintaining a task success rate comparable to state-of-the-art traditional methods.

Recently, multimodal largelanguagemodels (MLLMs) have shown great potential in image quality assessment (IQA) and image aesthetic assessment (IAA). Despite this progress, effectively scoring the quality and aesthetics of UGC images still faces two main challenges: 1) A single score is inadequate to capture the hierarchical human perception. 2) How to use MLLMs to output numerical scores, such as mean opinion scores (MOS), remains an open question. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel dataset, named Realistic image Quality and Aesthetic (RealQA), including 14,715 UGC images, each of which is annoted with 10 fine-grained attributes. These attributes span three levels: low level (e.g., image clarity), middle level (e.g., subject integrity) and high level (e.g., composition). Besides, we conduct a series of in-depth and comprehensive investigations into how to effectively predict numerical scores using MLLMs. Surprisingly, by predicting just two extra significant digits, the next token paradigm can achieve SOTA performance. Furthermore, with the help of chain of thought (CoT) combined with the learnt fine-grained attributes, the proposed method can outperform SOTA methods on five public datasets for IQA and IAA with superior interpretability and show strong zero-shot generalization for video quality assessment (VQA).

Programmers are required by regulations or application stores to provide privacy notices and labels describing these privacy behaviors. Although many tools and research prototypes have been developed to help programmers generate these notices by analyzing the source code, these approaches are often fairly coarse-grained (i.e., at the level of whole methods or files, rather than at the statement level). But this is not necessarily how privacy behaviors exist in code. Privacy behaviors are embedded in specific statements in code. Current literature does not examine what statements programmers see as most important, how consistent these views are, or how to detect them. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to examine which statements programmers view as most-related to privacy behaviors. We find that expression statements that make function calls are most associated with privacy behaviors, while the type of privacy label has little effect on the attributes of the selected statements. We then propose an approach to automatically detect these privacy-relevant statements by fine-tuning three largelanguagemodels with the data from the study. We observe that the agreement between our approach and participants is comparable to or higher than an agreement between two participants. Our study and detection approach can help programmers understand which statements in code affect privacy in mobile applications.","Submitted 3 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025."

However, on-device LLM fine-tuning poses great challenges due to extremely high memory requirements and slow training speeds. Even with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that update only a small subset of parameters, resource-constrained mobile devices cannot afford them. In this paper, we propose MobiLLM to enable memory-efficient transformer LLM fine-tuning on a mobile device via server-assisted side-tuning. Particularly, MobiLLM allows the resource-constrained mobile device to retain merely a frozen backbone model, while offloading the memory and computation-intensive backpropagation of a trainable side-network to a high-performance server. Unlike existing fine-tuning methods that keep trainable parameters inside the frozen backbone, MobiLLM separates a set of parallel adapters from the backbone to create a backpropagation bypass, involving only one-way activation transfers from the mobile device to the server with low-width quantization during forward propagation. In this way, the data never leaves the mobile device while the device can remove backpropagation through the local backbone model and its forward propagation can be paralyzed with the server-side execution. Thus, MobiLLM preserves data privacy while significantly reducing the memory and computational burdens for LLM fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MobiLLM can enable a resource-constrained mobile device, even a CPU-only one, to fine-tune LLMs and significantly reduce convergence time and memory usage.","Submitted 27 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."

The proposed method consists of two primary steps for predicting the moving port of the FA: the first involves utilizing the channel tables that encompass historical channel state information from all movable ports of the FA to forecast the channel tables for subsequent time periods; the second step entails selecting the port of the FA for the forthcoming time based on the predicted channel tables and the known reference channels that require alignment. To enhance the learning capabilities of the LLM model in the context of FA port prediction, we incorporate the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology. Furthermore, during the model training phase, we implement the warm-up-aided cosine learning rate (LR) technique to augment the accuracy of the predictions. The simulation results show that our model exhibits strong generalization ability and robustness under different numbers of base station antennas and medium-to-high mobility speeds of UE. In comparison to existing FA port calculation methods, the performance of the port predicted by our model demonstrates superior efficacy. Additionally, our model exhibits lower prediction costs and faster prediction and reasoning speeds.","Submitted 13 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."

In this paper, we propose SHARP (SHaring Adjacent Layers with Recovery Parameters), a novel approach to accelerate LLM inference by sharing parameters across adjacent layers, thus reducing memory load overhead, while introducing low-rank recovery parameters to maintain performance. Inspired by observations that consecutive layers have similar outputs, SHARP employs a two-stage recovery process: Single Layer Warmup (SLW), and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The SLW stage aligns the outputs of the shared layers using L_2 loss, providing a good initialization for the following SFT stage to further restore the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHARP can recover the model's perplexity on various in-distribution tasks using no more than 50k fine-tuning data while reducing the number of stored MLP parameters by 38% to 65%. We also conduct several ablation studies of SHARP and show that replacing layers towards the later parts of the model yields better performance retention, and that different recovery parameterizations perform similarly when parameter counts are matched. Furthermore, SHARP saves 42.8% in model storage and reduces the total inference time by 42.2% compared to the original Llama2-7b model on mobile devices. Our results highlight SHARP as an efficient solution for reducing inference costs in deploying LLMs without the need for pretraining-scale resources.","Submitted 10 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."

Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks.

In this paper, we propose an efficient LLM fine-tuning scheme in wireless networks, named Split Fine-Tuning (SFT), which can accommodate LLM fine-tuning on mobile devices. Specifically, an LLM is split into a server-side part on the edge server and a device-side part on the mobile device to satisfy the device-side memory constraint. All devices share a server-side model and perform parallel fine-tuning to reduce fine-tuning delay.

Furthermore, we formulate a fine-tuning delay minimization problem under accuracy and memory constraints, taking device heterogeneity and channel dynamics into account. To solve the problem, the nonlinear mixed-integer problem is decoupled into two subproblems in different timescales. The two-timescale resource management algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the compression rate and transformer block allocation in the large timescale using the augmented Lagrangian method, and determine spectrum resource allocation in the small timescale via sequential quadratic programming.

Lee","Quantization of LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) has recently gained popularity, particularly for on-device settings with limited hardware resources. While efficient, quantization inevitably degrades model quality, especially in aggressive low-bit settings such as 3-bit and 4-bit precision. In this paper, we propose DecDEC, an inference scheme that improves the quality of low-bit LLMs while preserving the key benefits of quantization: GPU memory savings and latency reduction. DecDEC stores the residual matrix -- the difference between full-precision and quantized weights -- in CPU, and dynamically fetches the residuals for only a small portion of the weights. This portion corresponds to the salient channels, marked by activation outliers, with the fetched residuals helping to correct quantization errors in these channels. Salient channels are identified dynamically at each decoding step by analyzing the input activations -- this enables adaptation to the dynamic nature of activation distribution, thus maximizing the effectiveness of error compensation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecDEC by augmenting state-of-the-art quantization methods. For example, DecDEC reduces the perplexity of a 3-bit Llama-3-8B-Instruct model from 10.15 to 9.12 -- outperforming its 3.5-bit counterpart -- while adding less than 0.0003\% to GPU memory usage and incurring only a 1.7\% inference slowdown on NVIDIA RTX 4050 Mobile.","Submitted 24 June, 2025; v1 submitted 28 December, 2024; originally announced December 2024."

The HLM token generation process follows the speculative inference principle: the SLM's vocabulary distribution is uploaded to the LLM, which either accepts or rejects it, with rejected tokens being resampled by the LLM. While this approach ensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it suffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the computation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose a novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM), wherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink transmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted. This opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear correlation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability. We analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk of rejection. Simulations show that U-HLM reduces uplink transmissions and LLM computations by 45.93%, while achieving up to 97.54% of the LLM's inference accuracy and 2.54\times

This is unfortunate for largelanguagemodel (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which results in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification.

In this paper, we present MLLM-Search, a novel zero-shot person search architecture that leverages multimodal largelanguagemodels (MLLM) to address the mobile robot problem of searching for a person under event-driven scenarios with varying user schedules. Our approach introduces a novel visual prompting method to provide robots with spatial understanding of the environment by generating a spatially grounded waypoint map, representing navigable waypoints by a topological graph and regions by semantic labels. This is incorporated into a MLLM with a region planner that selects the next search region based on the semantic relevance to the search scenario, and a waypoint planner which generates a search path by considering the semantically relevant objects and the local spatial context through our unique spatial chain-of-thought prompting approach. Extensive 3D photorealistic experiments were conducted to validate the performance of MLLM-Search in searching for a person with a changing schedule in different environments.

Current research mainly uses manual methods to detect dark patterns, a process that is time-consuming and struggles to keep pace with continually updating and emerging apps. While some studies targeted at automated detection, they are constrained to static patterns and still necessitate manual app exploration. To bridge these gaps, we present AppRay, an innovative system that seamlessly blends task-oriented app exploration with automated dark pattern detection, reducing manual efforts. Our approach consists of two steps: First, we harness the commonsense knowledge of largelanguagemodels for targeted app exploration, supplemented by traditional random exploration to capture a broader range of UI states. Second, we developed a static and dynamic dark pattern detector powered by a contrastive learning-based multi-label classifier and a rule-based refiner to perform detection. We contributed two datasets, AppRay-Dark and AppRay-Light, with 2,185 unique deceptive patterns (including 149 dynamic instances) across 18 types from 876 UIs and 871 benign UIs.

However, the openness of crowdsourced testing presents challenges, particularly in the manual review of numerous test reports, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Objective: The primary goal of this research is to improve the efficiency of review processes in crowdsourced testing. Traditional approaches to test report prioritization lack a deep understanding of semantic information in textual descriptions of these reports. This paper introduces LLMPrior, a novel approach for prioritizing crowdsourced test reports using largelanguagemodels (LLMs). Method: LLMPrior leverages LLMs for the analysis and clustering of crowdsourced test reports based on the types of bugs revealed in their textual descriptions.

This study investigates whether LLMs exhibit biases in predicting human mobility -- a fundamental human behavior -- based on race and gender. Using three prominent LLMs -- GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude -- we analyzed their predictions of visitations to points of interest (POIs) for individuals, relying on prompts that included names with and without explicit demographic details. We find that LLMs frequently reflect and amplify existing societal biases. Specifically, predictions for minority groups were disproportionately skewed, with these individuals being significantly less likely to be associated with wealth-related points of interest (POIs). Gender biases were also evident, as female individuals were consistently linked to fewer career-related POIs compared to their male counterparts. These biased associations suggest that LLMs not only mirror but also exacerbate societal stereotypes, particularly in contexts involving race and gender.","Submitted 18 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024."

We observe that the ISA inherent in some of today's most popular LLMs varies significantly, with most models requiring user prompts with a clear security context to utilize their security knowledge and provide safe responses to users. Based on this observation, we created a comprehensive set of 30 scenarios to assess the ISA of LLMs. These scenarios benchmark the evaluated models with respect to all focus areas defined in a mobile ISA taxonomy. Among our findings is that ISA is mildly affected by changing the model's temperature, whereas adjusting the system prompt can substantially impact it.

Both of these tasks often require filling gaps in a partially specified sequence of visits - a new problem that we call ""controlled"" synthetic trajectory generation. Existing methods for next-location prediction or synthetic trajectory generation cannot solve this problem as they lack the mechanisms needed to constrain the generated sequences of visits. Moreover, existing approaches (1) frequently treat space and time as independent factors, an assumption that fails to hold true in real-world scenarios, and (2) suffer from challenges in accuracy of temporal prediction as they fail to deal with mixed distributions and the inter-relationships of different modes with latent variables (e.g., day-of-the-week). These limitations become even more pronounced when the task involves filling gaps within sequences instead of solely predicting the next visit. We introduce TrajGPT, a transformer-based, multi-task, joint spatiotemporal generative model to address these issues. Taking inspiration from largelanguagemodels, TrajGPT poses the problem of controlled trajectory generation as that of text infilling in natural language. TrajGPT integrates the spatial and temporal models in a transformer architecture through a Bayesian probability model that ensures that the gaps in a visit sequence are filled in a spatiotemporally consistent manner. Our experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that TrajGPT not only excels in controlled synthetic visit generation but also outperforms competing models in next-location prediction tasks - Relatively, TrajGPT achieves a 26-fold improvement in temporal accuracy while retaining more than 98% of spatial accuracy on average.","Submitted 6 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024."

A significant challenge, however, lies in the unstructured nature of social media data. In other words, textual data like social media is not labeled, and large-scale manual annotations are cost-prohibitive. In this study, we introduce a novel methodological framework utilizing LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) to infer the mentioned travel modes from social media posts, and reason people's attitudes toward the associated travel mode, without the need for manual annotation. We compare different LLMs along with various prompting engineering methods in light of human assessment and LLM verification. We find that most social media posts manifest negative rather than positive sentiments. We thus identify the contributing factors to these negative posts and, accordingly, propose recommendations to traffic operators and policymakers.","Submitted 4 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024."

These sequences offer valuable insights into users' intentions and preferences. Yet, existing models analyzing check-in sequences fail to consider the semantics contained in these sequences, which closely reflect human visiting intentions and travel preferences, leading to an incomplete comprehension. Drawing inspiration from the exceptional semantic understanding and contextual information processing capabilities of largelanguagemodels (LLMs) across various domains, we present Mobility-LLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze check-in sequences for multiple tasks. Since LLMs cannot directly interpret check-ins, we reprogram these sequences to help LLMs comprehensively understand the semantics of human visiting intentions and travel preferences. Specifically, we introduce a visiting intention memory network (VIMN) to capture the visiting intentions at each record, along with a shared pool of human travel preference prompts (HTPP) to guide the LLM in understanding users' travel preferences. These components enhance the model's ability to extract and leverage semantic information from human mobility data effectively.

However, as the robot's environment scales (e.g., number of entities tracked) and the complexity of scene graph information increases (e.g., maintaining more attributes), providing the 3DSG as-is to an LLM-based planner quickly becomes infeasible due to input token count limits and attentional biases present in LLMs. Inspired by the successes of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods that retrieve query-relevant document chunks for LLM question and answering, we adapt the paradigm for our embodied domain.

However, given security and privacy concerns, building large-scale motion time series datasets remains difficult, preventing the development of pre-trained models for human activity analysis. Typically, existing models are trained and tested on the same dataset, leading to poor generalizability across variations in device location, device mounting orientation and human activity type. In this paper, we introduce UniMTS, the first unified pre-training procedure for motion time series that generalizes across diverse device latent factors and activities. Specifically, we employ a contrastive learning framework that aligns motion time series with text descriptions enriched by largelanguagemodels. This helps the model learn the semantics of time series to generalize across activities. Given the absence of large-scale motion time series data, we derive and synthesize time series from existing motion skeleton data with all-joint coverage. Spatio-temporal graph networks are utilized to capture the relationships across joints for generalization across different device locations. We further design rotation-invariant augmentation to make the model agnostic to changes in device mounting orientations.

While lightweight LLMs have been developed to fit mobile environments, they suffer from degraded model accuracy. In contrast, sparsity-based techniques minimize DRAM usage by selectively transferring only relevant neurons to DRAM while retaining the full model in external storage, such as flash. However, such approaches are critically limited by numerous I/O operations, particularly on smartphones with severe IOPS constraints. In this paper, we propose Ripple, a novel approach that accelerates LLM inference on smartphones by optimizing neuron placement in flash memory. Ripple leverages the concept of Neuron Co-Activation, where neurons frequently activated together are linked to facilitate continuous read access and optimize data transfer efficiency. Our approach incorporates a two-stage solution: an offline stage that reorganizes neuron placement based on co-activation patterns, and an online stage that employs tailored data access and caching strategies to align well with hardware characteristics. Evaluations conducted on a variety of smartphones and LLMs demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5.93x improvements in I/O latency compared to the state-of-the-art.

However, due to sequential processing through a stack of transformer layers, autoregressive decoding faces significant computation/latency challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile and edge devices. Existing approaches in literature that aim to improve latency via skipping layers have two distinct flavors - 1) Early exit, and 2) Input-agnostic heuristics where tokens exit at pre-determined layers irrespective of input sequence. Both the above strategies have limitations - the former cannot be applied to handle KV Caching necessary for speed-ups in modern framework and the latter does not capture the variation in layer importance across tasks or more generally, across input sequences. To address both limitations, we propose FiRST, an algorithm that reduces inference latency by using layer-specific routers to select a subset of transformer layers adaptively for each input sequence - the prompt (during the prefill stage) decides which layers will be skipped during decoding. FiRST preserves compatibility with KV caching enabling faster inference while being quality-aware. FiRST is model-agnostic and can be easily enabled on any pre-trained LLM. Our approach reveals that input adaptivity is critical - indeed, different task-specific middle layers play a crucial role in evolving hidden representations depending on tasks. Extensive experiments show that FiRST significantly reduces latency while outperforming other layer selection strategies in quality metics. It retains competitive performance to base model (without layer skipping) and in some cases, even improves upon it.

Traditional model-based methods often face challenges with the low accuracy of bus state prediction and passenger demand estimation. In contrast, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as a data-driven approach, has demonstrated great potential in formulating bus holding strategies. RL determines the optimal control strategies in order to maximize the cumulative reward, which reflects the overall control goals. However, translating sparse and delayed control goals in real-world tasks into dense and real-time rewards for RL is challenging, normally requiring extensive manual trial-and-error. In view of this, this study introduces an automatic reward generation paradigm by leveraging the in-context learning and reasoning capabilities of LargeLanguageModels (LLMs). This new paradigm, termed the LLM-enhanced RL, comprises several LLM-based modules: reward initializer, reward modifier, performance analyzer, and reward refiner. These modules cooperate to initialize and iteratively improve the reward function according to the feedback from training and test results for the specified RL-based task. Ineffective reward functions generated by the LLM are filtered out to ensure the stable evolution of the RL agents' performance over iterations. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed LLM-enhanced RL paradigm, it is applied to extensive bus holding control scenarios that vary in the number of bus lines, stops, and passenger demand.

Existing methods typically rely on discrete IDs to represent locations, which inherently overlook spatial relationships and cannot generalize across cities. In this paper, we propose NextLocLLM, which leverages the advantages of largelanguagemodels (LLMs) in processing natural language descriptions and their strong generalization capabilities for next location prediction. Specifically, instead of using IDs, NextLocLLM encodes locations based on continuous spatial coordinates to better model spatial relationships. These coordinates are further normalized to enable robust cross-city generalization. Another highlight of NextlocLLM is its LLM-enhanced POI embeddings. It utilizes LLMs' ability to encode each POI category's natural language description into embeddings. These embeddings are then integrated via nonlinear projections to form this LLM-enhanced POI embeddings, effectively capturing locations' functional attributes. Furthermore, task and data prompt prefix, together with trajectory embeddings, are incorporated as input for partly-frozen LLM backbone. NextLocLLM further introduces prediction retrieval module to ensure structural consistency in prediction.

While several literature surveys exist on academic contributions to these trends, we are the first to provide a practitioner's view. We analyze 155 FM4SE and 997 SE4FM blog posts from leading technology companies, leveraging an FM-powered surveying approach to systematically label and summarize the discussed activities and tasks.

While foundational largelanguagemodels (LLMs) from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic guard against both harmful behaviors and toxic strings, previous work on math solutions that embed harmful prompts demonstrate that the guardrails may differ between expert contexts. These loopholes would appear in mixture of expert's models when the context of the question changes and may offer fewer malicious training examples to filter toxic comments or recommended offensive actions. The present work demonstrates that foundational models may refuse to propose destructive actions correctly when prompted overtly but may unfortunately drop their guard when presented with a sudden change of context, like solving a computer programming challenge. We show empirical examples with trojan-hosting repositories like GitHub, NPM, NuGet, and popular content delivery networks (CDN) like jsDelivr which amplify the attack surface. In the LLM's directives to be helpful, example recommendations propose application programming interface (API) endpoints which a determined domain-squatter could acquire and setup attack mobile infrastructure that triggers from the naively copied code.

Prior work has shown the possibility to cut costs while maintaining similar accuracy, but has neglected to focus on risk control. By contrast, here we present hierarchical chains with multi-level abstention (HCMA), which use model-intrinsic uncertainty to delegate queries along the LLM intelligence hierarchy, enabling training-free model switching based solely on black-box API calls. Our framework presents novel trade-offs between efficiency and risk. For example, deploying HCMA on MMLU cuts the error rate of Llama3 405B by 30% when the model is allowed to abstain on 20% of the queries. To calibrate HCMA for optimal performance, our approach uses data-efficient logistic regressions (based on a simple nonlinear feature transformation), which require only 50 or 100 labeled examples to achieve excellent calibration error (ECE), cutting ECE by 50% compared to naive Platt scaling. On free-form generation tasks, we find that chain-of-thought is ineffectual for selective prediction, whereas zero-shot prompting drives error to 0% on TruthfulQA at high abstention rates.

However, deploying existing safety guard models with billions of parameters alongside LLMs on mobile devices is impractical due to substantial memory requirements and latency. To reduce this cost, we distill a large teacher safety guard model into a smaller one using a labeled dataset of instruction-response pairs with binary harmfulness labels. Due to the limited diversity of harmful instructions in the existing labeled dataset, naively distilled models tend to underperform compared to larger models. To bridge the gap between small and large models, we propose HarmAug, a simple yet effective data augmentation method that involves jailbreaking an LLM and prompting it to generate harmful instructions. Given a prompt such as, ""Make a single harmful instruction prompt that would elicit offensive content"", we add an affirmative prefix (e.g., ""I have an idea for a prompt:"") to the LLM's response. This encourages the LLM to continue generating the rest of the response, leading to sampling harmful instructions. Another LLM generates a response to the harmful instruction, and the teacher model labels the instruction-response pair. We empirically show that our HarmAug outperforms other relevant baselines. Moreover, a 435-million-parameter safety guard model trained with HarmAug achieves an F1 score comparable to larger models with over 7 billion parameters, and even outperforms them in AUPRC, while operating at less than 25% of their computational cost.","Submitted 24 February, 2025; v1 submitted 2 October, 2024; originally announced October 2024."

As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a LargeLanguageModel (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps.

To address this issue, we introduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and short-term memory modules, enhancing largelanguagemodels (LLMs) for planning in embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes between long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing comprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while short-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states. This dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene experiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning. Short-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory replacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding less pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with memory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x and 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator, respectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x.

Drawing on the analogy of human travelers acquiring local knowledge, we propose a framework in which a traveler robot (student) communicates with local robots (teachers) to obtain ON knowledge through minimal interactions. We frame this process as a data-free continual learning (CL) challenge, aiming to transfer knowledge from a black-box model (teacher) to a new model (student). In contrast to approaches like zero-shot ON using largelanguagemodels (LLMs), which utilize inherently communication-friendly natural language for knowledge representation, the other two major ON approaches -- frontier-driven methods using object feature maps and learning-based ON using neural state-action maps -- present complex challenges where data-free KT remains largely uncharted. To address this gap, we propose a lightweight, plug-and-play KT module targeting non-cooperative black-box teachers in open-world settings. Using the universal assumption that every teacher robot has vision and mobility capabilities, we define state-action history as the primary knowledge base.

Traditionally, this process has been approached as a sequential UI-event-mapping problem, where events in the source app are mapped to those in the target one based on their textual descriptions. Prior research has extensively focused on enhancing the event-mapping accuracy of NLP models. Although the advent of largelanguagemodels (LLMs) with impressive NLP capabilities suggests the potential for near-perfect event-mapping, our study demonstrates that even the highly accurate event-mapping of LLMs is insufficient to address the implementation discrepancies between the source and the target apps, reducing the overall effectiveness of LLM-driven solutions for UI test migration. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose SAIL, a skill-adaptive imitation learning framework designed to enhance the effectiveness of UI test migration through two key designs. First, SAIL leverages the source test cases as demonstrations and employs a multi-level abstraction of test cases' underlying skills, so as to extract the testing information from source test cases as the knowledge base for the subsequent test generation on the target app. Second, SAIL selectively reuses a subset of the learned skills to guide the generation of test cases for the target app with its novel context- and history-aware skill adaptation. While SAIL can be instantiated with any imitation learning techniques, we utilize the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to instantiate SAIL.

In AgentMove, we first decompose the mobility prediction task and design specific modules to complete them, including spatial-temporal memory for individual mobility pattern mining, world knowledge generator for modeling the effects of urban structure and collective knowledge extractor for capturing the shared patterns among population. Finally, we combine the results of three modules and conduct a reasoning step to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments utilizing mobility data from two distinct sources reveal that AgentMove surpasses the leading baseline by 3.33% to 8.57% across 8 out of 12 metrics and it shows robust predictions with various LLMs as base and also less geographical bias across cities.

The system monitors a user's execution of registered services on their smartphones (via accessibility service) and proactively requests a single-sentence reason from the user. By utilizing a LargeLanguageModel (LLM), SayRea parses the reason and predicts contextual relationships between the observed service and potential contexts (such as setting the alarm clock deep in the evening). In this way, SayRea can significantly reduce the cognitive load on users in anticipating future needs and selecting contextual attributes. A 10-day field study involving 20 participants showed that SayRea accumulated an average of 62.4 rules per user and successfully recommended 45% of service usage.

However, deploying LLMs on edge devices poses several challenges with respect to memory, energy, and compute costs, limiting their widespread use in devices such as mobile phones. A promising solution is to reduce the number of bits used to represent weights and activations. While existing works have found partial success at quantizing LLMs to lower bitwidths, e.g. 4-bit weights, quantizing activations beyond 16 bits often leads to large computational overheads due to poor on-device quantization support, or a considerable accuracy drop. Yet, 8-bit activations are very attractive for on-device deployment as they would enable LLMs to fully exploit mobile-friendly hardware, e.g. Neural Processing Units (NPUs). In this work, we make a first attempt to facilitate the on-device deployment of LLMs using integer-only quantization. We first investigate the limitations of existing quantization methods for on-device deployment, with a special focus on activation quantization. We then address these limitations by introducing a simple post-training quantization method, named MobileQuant, that extends previous weight equivalent transformation works by jointly optimizing the weight transformation and activation range parameters in an end-to-end manner. MobileQuant demonstrates superior capabilities over existing methods by 1) achieving near-lossless quantization on a wide range of LLM benchmarks, 2) reducing latency and energy consumption by 20\%-50\% compared to current on-device quantization strategies, 3) requiring limited compute budget, 4) being compatible with mobile-friendly compute units, e.g. NPU.","Submitted 4 October, 2024; v1 submitted 25 August, 2024; originally announced August 2024."

Existing models predominantly focus on spatiotemporal patterns, paying less attention to the underlying intentions that govern movements. Recent advancements in largelanguagemodels (LLMs) offer a promising alternative research angle for integrating commonsense reasoning into mobility prediction. However, it is a non-trivial problem because LLMs are not natively built for mobility intention inference, and they also face scalability issues and integration difficulties with spatiotemporal models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LIMP (LLMs for Intent-ware Mobility Prediction) framework. Specifically, LIMP introduces an ""Analyze-Abstract-Infer"" (A2I) agentic workflow to unleash LLM's commonsense reasoning power for mobility intention inference. Besides, we design an efficient fine-tuning scheme to transfer reasoning power from commercial LLM to smaller-scale, open-source language model, ensuring LIMP's scalability to millions of mobility records. Moreover, we propose a transformer-based intention-aware mobility prediction model to effectively harness the intention inference ability of LLM. Evaluated on two real-world datasets, LIMP significantly outperforms baseline models, demonstrating improved accuracy in next-location prediction and effective intention inference.

Traditional approaches typically involve training dedicated models for each specific degradation, resulting in inefficiency and redundancy. More recent solutions either introduce additional modules to learn visual prompts significantly increasing model size or incorporate cross-modal transfer from largelanguagemodels trained on vast datasets, adding complexity to the system architecture. In contrast, our approach, termed RAM, takes a unified path that leverages inherent similarities across various degradations to enable both efficient and comprehensive restoration through a joint embedding mechanism without scaling up the model or relying on large multimodal models. Specifically, we examine the sub-latent space of each input, identifying key components and reweighting them in a gated manner. This intrinsic degradation awareness is further combined with contextualized attention in an X-shaped framework, enhancing local-global interactions. Extensive benchmarking in an all-in-one restoration setting confirms RAM's SOTA performance, reducing model complexity by approximately 82% in trainable parameters and 85% in FLOPs. Our code and models will be publicly available.","Submitted 18 December, 2024; v1 submitted 18 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."
