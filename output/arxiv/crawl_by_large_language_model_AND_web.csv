This study provides a systematic review of selected empirical studies on LLMs in computer programming education, published from 2023 to March 2024. The data for this review were collected from Web of Science (SCI/SSCI), SCOPUS, and EBSCOhost databases, as well as three conference proceedings specialized in computer programming education. In total, 42 studies met the selection criteria and were reviewed using methods, including bibliometric analysis, thematic analysis, and structural topic modeling. This study offers an overview of the current state of LLMs in computer programming education research. It outlines LLMs' applications, benefits, limitations, concerns, and implications for future research and practices, establishing connections between LLMs and their practical use in computer programming education. This review also provides examples and valuable insights for instructional designers, instructors, and learners. Additionally, a conceptual framework is proposed to guide education practitioners in integrating LLMs into computer programming education. This study suggests future research directions from various perspectives, emphasizing the need to expand research methods and topics in computer programming education as LLMs evolve. Additionally, future research in the field should incorporate collaborative, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary efforts on a large scale, focusing on longitudinal research and development initiatives.","Submitted 13 April, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts, while general-purpose multimodal largelanguagemodels (MLLMs) lack sufficient accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods. Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of 80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied by a web app.","Submitted 24 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

In this work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes, such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions, evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%, -1.61\%
 compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.","Submitted 17 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3) Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification to ensure the integrity of the data.

Eliminating the influence of such problematic datapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model on datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally prohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to eliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving the model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and undoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the influence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts capturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental results demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine unlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation metrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more flexible largelanguagemodels that are capable of data erasure.","Submitted 25 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a largelanguagemodel (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence. DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases.

Leveraging web-scale pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities.

To address this, a growing body of research focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods.

Traditionally, students ask instructors or search dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings, subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to train. Largelanguagemodels (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages largelanguagemodels (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time feedback and suggestions using largelanguagemodels. This unique scaffolding structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing experience with personalized feedback and guidance.

However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features, which we term ""Fake Features"", that misrepresent the model's internal activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of SAE training datasets.","Submitted 21 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

Unlike centralized systems where context is securely stored server-side, agent memory is often managed client-side or by third-party applications, creating significant security vulnerabilities. This was recently exploited to attack production systems. We introduce and formalize ""plan injection,"" a novel context manipulation attack that corrupts these agents' internal task representations by targeting this vulnerable context. Through systematic evaluation of two popular web agents, Browser-use and Agent-E, we show that plan injections bypass robust prompt injection defenses, achieving up to 3x higher attack success rates than comparable prompt-based attacks.

A Comparative Study on Issue Identification in Heuristic Evaluation,"Guilherme Guerino, Luiz Rodrigues, Bruna Capeleti, Rafael Ferreira Mello, André Freire, Luciana Zaina","Heuristic evaluation is a widely used method in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to inspect interfaces and identify issues based on heuristics. Recently, LargeLanguageModels (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, have been applied in HCI to assist in persona creation, the ideation process, and the analysis of semi-structured interviews. However, considering the need to understand heuristics and the high degree of abstraction required to evaluate them, LLMs may have difficulty conducting heuristic evaluation. However, prior research has not investigated GPT-4o's performance in heuristic evaluation compared to HCI experts in web-based systems. In this context, this study aims to compare the results of a heuristic evaluation performed by GPT-4o and human experts. To this end, we selected a set of screenshots from a web system and asked GPT-4o to perform a heuristic evaluation based on Nielsen's Heuristics from a literature-grounded prompt. Our results indicate that only 21.2% of the issues identified by human experts were also identified by GPT-4o, despite it found 27 new issues. We also found that GPT-4o performed better for heuristics related to aesthetic and minimalist design and match between system and real world, whereas it has difficulty identifying issues in heuristics related to flexibility, control, and user efficiency. Additionally, we noticed that GPT-4o generated several false positives due to hallucinations and attempts to predict issues.

Arık, Tomas Pfister","Agents based on largelanguagemodels (LLMs) for machine learning engineering (MLE) can automatically implement ML models via code generation. However, existing approaches to build such agents often rely heavily on inherent LLM knowledge and employ coarse exploration strategies that modify the entire code structure at once. This limits their ability to select effective task-specific models and perform deep exploration within specific components, such as experimenting extensively with feature engineering options. To overcome these, we propose MLE-STAR, a novel approach to build MLE agents. MLE-STAR first leverages external knowledge by using a search engine to retrieve effective models from the web, forming an initial solution, then iteratively refines it by exploring various strategies targeting specific ML components. This exploration is guided by ablation studies analyzing the impact of individual code blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel ensembling method using an effective strategy suggested by MLE-STAR. Our experimental results show that MLE-STAR achieves medals in 44% of the Kaggle competitions on the MLE-bench, significantly outperforming the best alternative.","Submitted 27 May, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

However, in-home meal assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g., eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV), food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii) diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences, and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently adapted using a largelanguagemodel. We evaluate our system based on the personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the system. In all cases, users successfully personalize FEAST to meet their individual needs and preferences.

To address these challenges, we present FrontendBench, a benchmark co-developed by humans and LLMs. FrontendBench categorizes tasks based on code functionality and incorporates interactive test scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of front-end code generation capabilities. The benchmark comprises 148 meticulously crafted prompt-test case pairs spanning five levels of web components, from basic UI elements to complex interactive features.

Natural language processing technologies, represented by LargeLanguageModels (LLMs), have been widely applied to climate change-specific research, providing essential information support for decision-makers and the public. Some studies have improved model performance on relevant tasks by constructing climate change-related instruction data and instruction-tuning LLMs. However, current research remains inadequate in efficiently producing large volumes of high-precision instruction data for climate change, which limits further development of climate change LLMs. This study introduces an automated method for constructing instruction data. The method generates instructions using facts and background knowledge from documents and enhances the diversity of the instruction data through web scraping and the collection of seed instructions. Using this method, we constructed a climate change instruction dataset, named ClimateChat-Corpus, which was used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, resulting in an LLM named ClimateChat. Evaluation results show that ClimateChat significantly improves performance on climate change question-and-answer tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of different base models and instruction data on LLM performance and demonstrated its capability to adapt to a wide range of climate change scientific discovery tasks, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate base model for instruction tuning.

At the 100M parameter scale, using a curriculum transitioning from synthetic short stories to general web data, CGLS outperforms baseline methods on the question-answering benchmarks PIQA and ARC. Pretraining at the 1.2B scale, we stratify the DataComp-LM corpus with a DistilBERT-based classifier and progress from general text to highly technical or specialized content.

Consequently, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO). We are beginning to see dedicated C-SEO methods for modifying web documents to increase their visibility in CSE responses. However, they are often tested only for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains. Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains, and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors.

Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research: rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic capabilities.

The advent of Multimodal LargeLanguageModels (MLLMs) presents potential for alleviating the issue, but they are difficult to comprehend the complex layouts in UIs and generate the accurate code with layout preserved.

Specifically, CER accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer. These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments. We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena, CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand it better.","Submitted 7 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

However, designing high-performing agentic systems remains challenging. Existing agent search methods suffer from three major limitations: (1) an emphasis on optimizing agentic workflows while under-utilizing proven human-designed components such as memory, planning, and tool use; (2) high evaluation costs, as each newly generated agent must be fully evaluated on benchmarks; and (3) inefficient search in large search space. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework to address these challenges. First, We propose a hierarchical search space that jointly models agentic workflow and composable functional components, enabling richer agentic system designs. Building on this structured design space, we introduce a predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement trajectories.

To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history.

In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around 12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources, revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however, the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on the model's parametric knowledge.

To address these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs, while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight vector to balance their influence.

In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the ""data wall"" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction.

This task has a lower tolerance for decision-making errors at each step, as any mistakes may cumulatively disrupt the process and potentially lead to irreversible outcomes like deletions or payments. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-operative critic mechanism that provides effective feedback prior to the actual execution, by reasoning about the potential outcome and correctness of actions. Specifically, we propose a Suggestion-aware Gradient Relative Policy Optimization (S-GRPO) strategy to construct our pre-operative critic model GUI-Critic-R1, incorporating a novel suggestion reward to enhance the reliability of the model's feedback.

Traditional detection approaches rely on machine learning classifiers or rule-based scanners operating in the cloud, but these face significant challenges in generalization, privacy, and evasion by sophisticated threats. In this paper, we propose a novel client-side framework for comprehensive URL analysis that leverages zero-shot inference by a local largelanguagemodel (LLM) running entirely in-browser. Our system uses a compact LLM (e.g., 3B/8B parameters) via WebLLM to perform reasoning over rich context collected from the target webpage, including static code analysis (JavaScript abstract syntax trees, structure, and code patterns), dynamic sandbox execution results (DOM changes, API calls, and network requests),and visible content. We detail the architecture and methodology of the system, which combines a real browser sandbox (using iframes) resistant to common anti-analysis techniques, with an LLM-based analyzer that assesses potential vulnerabilities and malicious behaviors without any task-specific training (zero-shot). The LLM aggregates evidence from multiple sources (code, execution trace, page content) to classify the URL as benign or malicious and to provide an explanation of the threats or security issues identified. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of benign and malicious URLs, demonstrating that even a compact client-side model can achieve high detection accuracy and insightful explanations comparable to cloud-based solutions, while operating privately on end-user devices. The results show that client-side LLM inference is a feasible and effective solution to web threat analysis, eliminating the need to send potentially sensitive data to cloud services.","Submitted 4 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

In this work, we present a systematic analysis of agentic workflows under deceptive or misleading feedback.

Using this taxonomy, we construct a suite of judge behaviors and develop WAFER-QA, a new benchmark with critiques grounded in retrieved web evidence to evaluate robustness of agentic workflows against factually supported adversarial feedback. We reveal that even strongest agents are vulnerable to persuasive yet flawed critiques -- often switching correct answers after a single round of misleading feedback. Taking a step further, we study how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction, revealing distinct behavioral patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning models.

Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model behavior.

Recent work incorporates largelanguagemodels (LLMs) for GUI testing. However, these approaches face various challenges, including low efficiency of LLMs, high complexity of rich web application contexts, and a low success rate of LLMs in executing GUI tasks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Temac, an approach that enhances AWGT using LLM-based multi-agent collaboration to increase code coverage. Temac is motivated by our insight that LLMs can enhance AWGT in executing complex functionalities, while the information discovered during AWGT can, in turn, be provided as the domain knowledge to improve the LLM-based task execution. Specifically, given a web application, Temac initially runs an existing approach to broadly explore application states. When the testing coverage stagnates, Temac then employs LLM-based agents to summarize the collected information to form a knowledge base and to infer not-covered functionalities. Guided by this knowledge base, Temac finally uses specialized LLM-based agents to target and execute the not-covered functionalities, reaching deeper states beyond those explored by the existing approach. Our evaluation results show that Temac exceeds state-of-the-art approaches from 12.5% to 60.3% on average code coverage on six complex open-source web applications, while revealing 445 unique failures in the top 20 real-world web applications.

Detecting and Contextualizing Harmful Language in Cultural Heritage Collections","Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Jason Liartis, Kristina Rose, Antoine Isaac, Giorgos Stamou","Cultural Heritage (CH) data hold invaluable knowledge, reflecting the history, traditions, and identities of societies, and shaping our understanding of the past and present. However, many CH collections contain outdated or offensive descriptions that reflect historical biases. CH Institutions (CHIs) face significant challenges in curating these data due to the vast scale and complexity of the task. To address this, we develop an AI-powered tool that detects offensive terms in CH metadata and provides contextual insights into their historical background and contemporary perception. We leverage a multilingual vocabulary co-created with marginalized communities, researchers, and CH professionals, along with traditional NLP techniques and LargeLanguageModels (LLMs). Available as a standalone web app and integrated with major CH platforms, the tool has processed over 7.9 million records, contextualizing the contentious terms detected in their metadata. Rather than erasing these terms, our approach seeks to inform, making biases visible and providing actionable insights for creating more inclusive and accessible CH collections.","Submitted 30 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data -- is widely regarded the gold standard, believed to be robust against privacy-related attacks. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by introducing a novel data extraction attack that compromises even exact unlearning. Our method leverages both the pre- and post-unlearning models: by guiding the post-unlearning model using signals from the pre-unlearning model, we uncover patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase the risk of privacy leakage, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.","Submitted 30 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Existing methods rely on static prompting rules or training with Wikipedia-based corpora and retrieval environments, limiting adaptability to the real-world web environment where ambiguity, conflicting evidence, and noise are prevalent. These constrained training settings hinder LLMs from learning to dynamically decide when and where to search, and how to adjust search depth and frequency based on informational demands. We define this missing capacity as Search Intensity Scaling (SIS)--the emergent skill to intensify search efforts under ambiguous or conflicting conditions, rather than settling on overconfident, under-verification answers. To study SIS, we introduce WebPuzzle, the first dataset designed to foster information-seeking behavior in open-world internet environments. WebPuzzle consists of 24K training instances and 275 test questions spanning both wiki-based and open-web queries. Building on this dataset, we propose DeepDiver, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that promotes SIS by encouraging adaptive search policies through exploration under a real-world open-web environment. Experimental results show that Pangu-7B-Reasoner empowered by DeepDiver achieve performance on real-web tasks comparable to the 671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1. We detail DeepDiver's training curriculum from cold-start supervised fine-tuning to a carefully designed RL phase, and present that its capability of SIS generalizes from closed-form QA to open-ended tasks such as long-form writing.

Nalepa","The digitization of cultural heritage collections has opened new directions for research, yet the lack of enriched metadata poses a substantial challenge to accessibility, interoperability, and cross-institutional collaboration. In several past years neural networks models such as YOLOv11 and Detectron2 have revolutionized visual data analysis, but their application to domain-specific cultural artifacts - such as manuscripts and incunabula - remains limited by the absence of methodologies that address structural feature extraction and semantic interoperability. In this position paper, we argue, that the integration of neural networks with semantic technologies represents a paradigm shift in cultural heritage digitization processes. We present the Metadata Enrichment Model (MEM), a conceptual framework designed to enrich metadata for digitized collections by combining fine-tuned computer vision models, largelanguagemodels (LLMs) and structured knowledge graphs. The Multilayer Vision Mechanism (MVM) appears as the key innovation of MEM. This iterative process improves visual analysis by dynamically detecting nested features, such as text within seals or images within stamps. To expose MEM's potential, we apply it to a dataset of digitized incunabula from the Jagiellonian Digital Library and release a manually annotated dataset of 105 manuscript pages. We examine the practical challenges of MEM's usage in real-world GLAM institutions, including the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, the adjustment of enriched metadata with Linked Data standards and computational costs. We present MEM as a flexible and extensible methodology. This paper contributes to the discussion on how artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies can advance cultural heritage research, and also use these technologies in practice.","Submitted 29 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

These agents interact with environment through intermediate interfaces, such as predefined action spaces and interaction rules, which mediate the perception and action. However, mismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent regarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as \textbf{agent-environment misalignment}. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent strategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that agent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent performance.

In this paper, we show that when training LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense datasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data (arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit phase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size. Through controlled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped data, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical value, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the biographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost nothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly memorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity allocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack problem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation across datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio varies. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and reveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing ratio following a power-law relationship with the model size.

While social media posts are short and fragmented, inquiry submissions are detailed, multi-page documents offering structured insights. Our methodology integrates Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling with LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) to enhance semantic understanding. LDA reveals distinct opinions and geographic patterns, while LLMs improve filtering by identifying flood-relevant tweets using public submissions as a reference. This Relevance Index method reduces noise and prioritizes actionable content, improving situational awareness for emergency responders. By combining these complementary data streams, our approach introduces a novel AI-driven method to refine crisis-related social media content, improve real-time disaster response, and inform long-term resilience planning.","Submitted 10 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

To systematically examine this risk, we pretrain language models (1B/3B/8B) from scratch on 83B tokens, mixing web-scale data with public domain books used to simulate copyrighted content at controlled frequencies at lengths at least ten times longer than prior work. We thereby identified the offset effect, a phenomenon characterized by two key findings: (1) verbatim memorization is most strongly triggered by short prefixes drawn from the beginning of the context window, with memorization decreasing counterintuitively as prefix length increases; and (2) a sharp decline in verbatim recall when prefix begins offset from the initial tokens of the context window. We attribute this to positional fragility: models rely disproportionately on the earliest tokens in their context window as retrieval anchors, making them sensitive to even slight shifts. We further observe that when the model fails to retrieve memorized content, it often produces degenerated text. Leveraging these findings, we show that shifting sensitive data deeper into the context window suppresses both extractable memorization and degeneration. Our results suggest that positional offset is a critical and previously overlooked axis for evaluating memorization risks, since prior work implicitly assumed uniformity by probing only from the beginning of training sequences.","Submitted 28 May, 2025; v1 submitted 19 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Recently, LLMs have been used to synthesize instruction data using seed question-answer (QA) pairs. However, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be similar to the input seeds, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose extracting instruction tuning data from web corpora that contain rich and diverse knowledge. A naive solution is to retrieve domain-specific documents and extract all QA pairs from them, but this faces two key challenges: (1) extracting all QA pairs using LLMs is prohibitively expensive, and (2) many extracted QA pairs may be irrelevant to the downstream tasks, potentially degrading model performance. To tackle these issues, we introduce EQUAL, an effective and scalable data extraction framework that iteratively alternates between document selection and high-quality QA pair extraction to enhance instruction tuning.

Existing efforts to study sensitive and PII data memorization and develop mitigation strategies are hampered by the absence of comprehensive, realistic, and ethically sourced datasets reflecting the diversity of sensitive information found on the web. We introduce PANORAMA - Profile-based Assemblage for Naturalistic Online Representation and Attribute Memorization Analysis, a large-scale synthetic corpus of 384,789 samples derived from 9,674 synthetic profiles designed to closely emulate the distribution, variety, and context of PII and sensitive data as it naturally occurs in online environments. Our data generation pipeline begins with the construction of internally consistent, multi-attribute human profiles using constrained selection to reflect real-world demographics such as education, health attributes, financial status, etc. Using a combination of zero-shot prompting and OpenAI o3-mini, we generate diverse content types - including wiki-style articles, social media posts, forum discussions, online reviews, comments, and marketplace listings - each embedding realistic, contextually appropriate PII and other sensitive information. We validate the utility of PANORAMA by fine-tuning the Mistral-7B model on 1x, 5x, 10x, and 25x data replication rates with a subset of data and measure PII memorization rates - revealing not only consistent increases with repetition but also variation across content types, highlighting PANORAMA's ability to model how memorization risks differ by context. Our dataset and code are publicly available, providing a much-needed resource for privacy risk assessment, model auditing, and the development of privacy-preserving LLMs.","Submitted 18 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Environmental prompt injection attacks manipulate the environment to induce the web agent to perform a specific, attacker-chosen action--referred to as the target action. However, existing attacks suffer from limited effectiveness or stealthiness, or are impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we propose EnvInjection, a new attack that addresses these limitations. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage, which can be implemented by modifying the webpage's source code. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the target action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple webpage datasets shows that EnvInjection is highly effective and significantly outperforms existing baselines.","Submitted 16 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods employ static, pre-inference retrieval strategies, making them inadequate for complex tasks involving ambiguous, multi-step, or evolving information needs. Recent advances in test-time scaling techniques have demonstrated significant potential in enabling LLMs to dynamically interact with external tools, motivating the shift toward adaptive inference-time retrieval. Inspired by Information Foraging Theory (IFT), we propose InForage, a reinforcement learning framework that formalizes retrieval-augmented reasoning as a dynamic information-seeking process. Unlike existing approaches, InForage explicitly rewards intermediate retrieval quality, encouraging LLMs to iteratively gather and integrate information through adaptive search behaviors. To facilitate training, we construct a human-guided dataset capturing iterative search and reasoning trajectories for complex, real-world web tasks. Extensive evaluations across general question answering, multi-hop reasoning tasks, and a newly developed real-time web QA dataset demonstrate InForage's superior performance over baseline methods.

Furthermore, criticism argues that the Turing Test primarily assesses deceptive mimicry rather than genuine intelligence, prompting the continuous emergence of alternative benchmarks. This study argues against discarding the Turing Test, proposing instead using more refined versions of it, for example, by interacting simultaneously with both an AI and human candidate to determine who is who, allowing a longer interaction duration, access to the Internet and other AIs, using experienced people as evaluators, etc. Through systematic experimentation using a web-based platform, we demonstrate that richer, contextually structured testing environments significantly enhance participants' ability to differentiate between AI and human interactions.

However, the complexity of ontology alignments, particularly rich correspondences (c : c), makes this process challenging. Existing approaches primarily focus on simple (s : s) and partially complex ( s : c) alignments, thereby overlooking the challenges posed by more expressive alignments. Moreover, the intricate syntax of SPARQL presents a barrier for non-expert users seeking to fully exploit the knowledge encapsulated in ontologies. This article proposes an innovative approach for the automatic rewriting of SPARQL queries from a source ontology to a target ontology, based on a user's need expressed in natural language. It leverages the principles of equivalence transitivity as well as the advanced capabilities of largelanguagemodels such as GPT-4. By integrating these elements, this approach stands out for its ability to efficiently handle complex alignments, particularly (c : c) correspondences , by fully exploiting their expressiveness. Additionally, it facilitates access to aligned ontologies for users unfamiliar with SPARQL, providing a flexible solution for querying heterogeneous data.","Submitted 2 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

This context often includes tacit knowledge about data provenance, quality, and intended use, which is rarely explicit in the dataset itself. We present the Data Therapist, a web-based tool that helps domain experts externalize this implicit knowledge through a mixed-initiative process combining iterative Q&A with interactive annotation. Powered by a largelanguagemodel, the system analyzes user-supplied datasets, prompts users with targeted questions, and allows annotation at varying levels of granularity. The resulting structured knowledge base can inform both human and automated visualization design. We evaluated the tool in a qualitative study involving expert pairs from Molecular Biology, Accounting, Political Science, and Usable Security.

Ryan, Danmei Xu, Chris Nivera, Daniel Campos","Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become one of the most popular methods for bringing knowledge-intensive context to largelanguagemodels (LLM) because of its ability to bring local context at inference time without the cost or data leakage risks associated with fine-tuning. A clear separation of private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context. Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over private documents.","Submitted 30 April, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Existing accident data collection is largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination, dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning (8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also developed with usage instructions.

Despite decades of research, XSS remains among the top 10 security vulnerabilities. Researchers have proposed various techniques to protect systems from XSS attacks, with machine learning (ML) being one of the most widely used methods. An ML model is trained on a dataset to identify potential XSS threats, making its effectiveness highly dependent on the size and diversity of the training data. A variation of XSS is obfuscated XSS, where attackers apply obfuscation techniques to alter the code's structure, making it challenging for security systems to detect its malicious intent. Our study's random forest model was trained on traditional (non-obfuscated) XSS data achieved 99.8% accuracy. However, when tested against obfuscated XSS samples, accuracy dropped to 81.9%, underscoring the importance of training ML models with obfuscated data to improve their effectiveness in detecting XSS attacks. A significant challenge is to generate highly complex obfuscated code despite the availability of several public tools. These tools can only produce obfuscation up to certain levels of complexity. In our proposed system, we fine-tune a LargeLanguageModel (LLM) to generate complex obfuscated XSS payloads automatically. By transforming original XSS samples into diverse obfuscated variants, we create challenging training data for ML model evaluation. Our approach achieved a 99.5% accuracy rate with the obfuscated dataset. We also found that the obfuscated samples generated by the LLMs were 28.1% more complex than those created by other tools, significantly improving the model's ability to handle advanced XSS attacks and making it more effective for real-world application security.","Submitted 28 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

Ridwanul Islam","Road accidents pose significant concerns globally. They lead to large financial losses, injuries, disabilities, and societal challenges. Accurate and timely accident data is essential for predicting and mitigating these events. This paper presents a novel framework named 'Durghotona GPT' that integrates web scraping and LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) to automate the generation of comprehensive accident datasets from prominent national dailies in Bangladesh. The authors collected accident reports from three major newspapers: Prothom Alo, Dhaka Tribune, and The Daily Star. The collected news was then processed using the newest available LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Llama-3. The framework efficiently extracts relevant information, categorizes reports, and compiles detailed datasets. Thus, this framework overcomes limitations of manual data collection methods such as delays, errors, and communication gaps. The authors' evaluation demonstrates that Llama-3, an open-source model, performs comparably to GPT-4. It achieved 89% accuracy in the authors' evaluation. Therefore, it can be considered a cost-effective alternative for similar tasks. The results suggest that the framework developed by the authors can drastically enhance the quality and availability of accident data. As a result, it can support critical applications in traffic safety analysis, urban planning, and public health. The authors also developed an interface for 'Durghotona GPT' for ease of use as part of this paper. Future work will focus on expanding data collection methods and refining LLMs to further increase dataset accuracy and applicability.","Submitted 23 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

Recent advancements, particularly in web environments, face a critical limitation: their performance will reach a stagnation point during autonomous learning cycles, hindering further improvement. We argue that this stems from limited exploration of the web environment and insufficient exploitation of pre-trained web knowledge in LLMs. To improve the performance of self-improvement, we propose a novel framework that introduces a co-evolving World Model LLM. This world model predicts the next observation based on the current observation and action within the web environment. Leveraging LLMs' pretrained knowledge of abundant web content, the World Model serves dual roles: (1) as a virtual web server generating self-instructed training data to continuously refine the agent's policy, and (2) as an imagination engine during inference, enabling look-ahead simulation to guide action selection for the agent LLM. Experiments in real-world web environments (Mind2Web-Live, WebVoyager, and GAIA-web) show a 10% performance gain over existing self-evolving agents, demonstrating the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, without using any distillation from more powerful close-sourced models. Our work establishes the necessity of integrating world models into autonomous agent frameworks to unlock sustained adaptability.","Submitted 22 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

Existing approaches for bias identification rely on datasets containing labels for the task of interest, something that a non-expert may not have access to, or may not have the necessary resources to collect: this greatly limits the number of tasks where model biases can be identified. In this work, we present Classifier-to-Bias (C2B), the first bias discovery framework that works without access to any labeled data: it only relies on a textual description of the classification task to identify biases in the target classification model. This description is fed to a largelanguagemodel to generate bias proposals and corresponding captions depicting biases together with task-specific target labels. A retrieval model collects images for those captions, which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the given biases. C2B is training-free, does not require any annotations, has no constraints on the list of biases, and can be applied to any pre-trained model on any classification task. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show that C2B discovers biases beyond those of the original datasets and outperforms a recent state-of-the-art bias detection baseline that relies on task-specific annotations, being a promising first step toward addressing task-agnostic unsupervised bias detection.","Submitted 29 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

A key focus in current black-box scanning is increasing test coverage (i.e., accessing more web pages). However, since many web applications are user-oriented, some deep pages can only be accessed through complex user interactions, which are difficult to reach by existing black-box scanners. To fill this gap, a key insight is that web pages contain a wealth of semantic information that can aid in understanding potential user intention.

However, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities and inability to distinguish between instructions and data content, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. These attacks manipulate LLMs into deviating from the original input instructions and executing maliciously injected instructions within data content, such as web documents retrieved from search engines. Existing defense methods, including prompt-engineering and fine-tuning approaches, typically instruct models to follow the original input instructions while suppressing their tendencies to execute injected instructions. However, our experiments reveal that suppressing instruction-following tendencies is challenging. Through analyzing failure cases, we observe that although LLMs tend to respond to any recognized instructions, they are aware of which specific instructions they are executing and can correctly reference them within the original prompt. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel defense method that leverages, rather than suppresses, the instruction-following abilities of LLMs. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate responses that include both answers and their corresponding instruction references. Based on these references, we filter out answers not associated with the original input instructions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prompt-engineering baselines and achieves performance comparable to fine-tuning methods, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0 percent in some scenarios.

However, VLMs are typically trained on massive web-scraped images, raising concerns over copyright infringement and privacy violations, and making data auditing increasingly urgent. Membership inference (MI), which determines whether a sample was used in training, has emerged as a key auditing technique, with promising results on open-source VLMs like LLaVA (AUC > 80%). In this work, we revisit these advances and uncover a critical issue: current MI benchmarks suffer from distribution shifts between member and non-member images, introducing shortcut cues that inflate MI performance. We further analyze the nature of these shifts and propose a principled metric based on optimal transport to quantify the distribution discrepancy. To evaluate MI in realistic settings, we construct new benchmarks with i.i.d. member and non-member images. Existing MI methods fail under these unbiased conditions, performing only marginally better than chance. Further, we explore the theoretical upper bound of MI by probing the Bayes Optimality within the VLM's embedding space and find the irreducible error rate remains high. Despite this pessimistic outlook, we analyze why MI for VLMs is particularly challenging and identify three practical scenarios--fine-tuning, access to ground-truth texts, and set-based inference--where auditing becomes feasible.

Web APIs that employ the REST style are known as RESTful (or REST) APIs. When using or testing a RESTful API, developers may need to employ its specification, which is often defined by open-source standards such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). However, it can be very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these specifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially when the software requirements change. Many tools and methods have been proposed to solve this problem, such as Respector and Swagger Core. OAS generation can be regarded as a common text-generation task that creates a formal description of API endpoints derived from the source code. A potential solution for this may involve using LargeLanguageModels (LLMs), which have strong capabilities in both code understanding and text generation. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach for generating the OASs of RESTful APIs using LLMs: LLM-based RESTful API-Specification Generation (LRASGen). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of LLMs and API source code to generate OASs for RESTful APIs. Compared with existing tools and methods, LRASGen can generate the OASs, even when the implementation is incomplete (with partial code, and/or missing annotations/comments, etc.). To evaluate the LRASGen performance, we conducted a series of empirical studies on 20 real-world RESTful APIs. The results show that two LLMs (GPT-4o mini and DeepSeek V3) can both support LARSGen to generate accurate specifications, and LRASGen-generated specifications cover an average of 48.85% more missed entities than the developer-provided specifications.","Submitted 23 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

The resulting tool, called CUBETESTERAI, includes a user-friendly web interface and the integration of a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab and Docker. These components streamline the automated test generation process, allowing developers to generate JUnit tests directly from their code snippets with minimal manual intervention. The final implementation executes the LLaMA models through RunPod, an online GPU service, which also enhances the privacy of our tool. Using the advanced natural language processing capabilities of the LLaMA model, CUBETESTERAI is able to generate test cases that provide high code coverage and accurate validation of software functionalities in Java-based Spring Boot applications. Furthermore, it efficiently manages resource-intensive operations and refines the generated tests to address common issues like missing imports and handling of private methods.

Nguyen, Vu Nguyen","In automated web testing, generating test scripts from natural language task descriptions is crucial for enhancing the test generation process. This activity involves creating the correct sequences of actions to form test scripts for future testing activities. Current state-of-the-art approaches are limited in generating these action sequences, as they either demand substantial manual effort for human demonstrations or fail to consider the history of previous web content and actions to decide the next action. In this paper, we introduce HxAgent, an iterative largelanguagemodel agent planning approach that determines the next action based on: 1) observations of the current contents and feasible actions, 2) short-term memory of previous web states and actions, and 3) long-term experience with (in)correct action sequences. The agent generates a sequence of actions to perform a given task, which is effectively an automated test case to verify the task. We conducted an extensive empirical evaluation of HxAgent using two datasets. On the MiniWoB++ dataset, our approach achieves 97% exact-match accuracy that is comparable to the best baselines while eliminating the need for human demonstrations required by those methods. For complex tasks requiring navigation through multiple actions and screens, HxAgent achieves an average 82% exact-match. On the second dataset, comprising 350 task instances across seven popular websites, including YouTube, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Google, HxAgent achieves high performance, with 87% of the action sequences exactly matching the ground truth and a prefix-match of 93%, outperforming the baseline by 59%.","Submitted 19 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

However, the generative nature of LLMs raises concerns about presenting misinformation as fact. To address this, we developed a web-based application that helps K-12 students enhance critical thinking by identifying misleading information in LLM responses about major historical figures. In this paper, we describe the implementation and design details of the DoYouTrustAI tool, which can be used to provide an interactive lesson which teaches students about the dangers of misinformation and how believable generative AI can make it seem. The DoYouTrustAI tool utilizes prompt engineering to present the user with AI generated summaries about the life of a historical figure. These summaries can be either accurate accounts of that persons life, or an intentionally misleading alteration of their history. The user is tasked with determining the validity of the statement without external resources.

Our tool lets users select familiar individuals for testing to reduce random guessing and presents misinformation alongside known facts to maintain believability.

Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework,"Feijiang Han, Jiaming Zhang, Chuyi Deng, Jianheng Tang, Yunhuai Liu","WebShell attacks, in which malicious scripts are injected into web servers, are a major cybersecurity threat. Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods are hampered by issues such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) have gained attention for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two major contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling (WBFP) that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all models lag behind previous State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. With BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improved, with an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Larger models such as GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 14B outperform SOTA methods, while smaller models such as Qwen 2.5 3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods.

While LLMs have shown promise in general web search scenarios, their effectiveness for evaluating domain-specific search results, such as educational resources, remains unexplored. To investigate different ways of including domain-specific criteria in LLM prompts for relevance judgement, we collected and released a dataset of 401 human relevance judgements from a user study involving teaching professionals performing search tasks related to lesson planning. We compared three approaches to structuring these prompts: a simple two-aspect evaluation baseline from prior work on using LLMs as relevance judges, a comprehensive 12-dimensional rubric derived from educational literature, and criteria directly informed by the study participants. Using domain-specific frameworks, LLMs achieved strong agreement with human judgements (Cohen's κ
 up to 0.650), significantly outperforming the baseline approach. The participant-derived framework proved particularly robust, with GPT-3.5 achieving κ
 scores of 0.639 and 0.613 for 10-dimension and 5-dimension versions respectively. System-level evaluation showed that LLM judgements reliably identified top-performing retrieval approaches (RBO scores 0.71-0.76) while maintaining reasonable discrimination between systems (RBO 0.52-0.56).

The framework is composed of three-tiered architecture with specialized agents: a Decomposition Agent that dissects complex queries into contextually coherent sub-tasks via semantic-aware query rewriting and schema-guided context augmentation; Multi-source Retrieval Agents that carry out parallel, modality-specific retrieval using plug-and-play modules designed for vector, graph, and web-based databases; and a Decision Agent that uses consistency voting to integrate multi-source answers and resolve discrepancies in retrieval results through Expert Model Refinement. This architecture attains comprehensive query understanding by combining textual, graph-relational, and web-derived evidence, resulting in a remarkable 12.95% improvement in answer accuracy and a 3.56% boost in question classification accuracy over baseline RAG systems on the ScienceQA and CrisisMMD benchmarks.

Our sample was selected (filtered) based on 1 (low filtering) or more (high filtering) Boolean conditions on the phi-3 SLM scores. We found low-moderate significant correlations between the scores from the SLM and human evaluators for sports injury texts with low filtering (\r{ho} = 0.3413, p < 0.001) and medicine/health texts with high filtering (\r{ho} = 0.3854, p < 0.001), and low significant correlation for medicine/health texts with low filtering (\r{ho} = 0.2255, p < 0.001). There was negligible, insignificant correlation for sports injury-related texts with high filtering (\r{ho} = 0.0318, p = 0.4466).","Submitted 31 March, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

While existing benchmarks focus on basic plan validity, they neglect critical aspects such as route efficiency, POI appeal, and real-time adaptability. This paper introduces TP-RAG, the first benchmark tailored for retrieval-augmented, spatiotemporal-aware travel planning. Our dataset includes 2,348 real-world travel queries, 85,575 fine-grain annotated POIs, and 18,784 high-quality travel trajectory references sourced from online tourist documents, enabling dynamic and context-aware planning. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that integrating reference trajectories significantly improves spatial efficiency and POI rationality of the travel plan, while challenges persist in universality and robustness due to conflicting references and noisy data. To address these issues, we propose EvoRAG, an evolutionary framework that potently synergizes diverse retrieved trajectories with LLMs' intrinsic reasoning. EvoRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving spatiotemporal compliance and reducing commonsense violation compared to ground-up and retrieval-augmented baselines.

Pesl,"Modern enterprise computing systems integrate numerous subsystems to resolve a common task by yielding emergent behavior. A widespread approach is using services implemented with Web technologies like REST or OpenAPI, which offer an interaction mechanism and service documentation standard, respectively. Each service represents a specific business functionality, allowing encapsulation and easier maintenance. Despite the reduced maintenance costs on an individual service level, increased integration complexity arises. Consequently, automated service composition approaches have arisen to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, these approaches have not achieved high acceptance in practice due to their reliance on complex formal modeling. Within this Ph.D. thesis, we analyze the application of LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) to automatically integrate the services based on a natural language input. The result is a reusable service composition, e.g., as program code. While not always generating entirely correct results, the result can still be helpful by providing integration engineers with a close approximation of a suitable solution, which requires little effort to become operational. Our research involves (i) introducing a software architecture for automated service composition using LLMs, (ii) analyzing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for service discovery, (iii) proposing a novel natural language query-based benchmark for service discovery, and (iv) extending the benchmark to complete service composition scenarios. We have presented our software architecture as Compositio Prompto, the analysis of RAG for service discovery, and submitted a proposal for the service discovery benchmark. Open topics are primarily the extension of the service discovery benchmark to service composition scenarios and the improvements of the service composition generation, e.g., using fine-tuning or LLM agents.","Submitted 11 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

Traditional Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) struggle to detect highly obfuscated and complex attacks, as their rules require manual updates. This paper presents a novel generative AI framework that leverages LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) to enhance XSS mitigation. The framework achieves two primary objectives: (1) generating sophisticated and syntactically validated XSS payloads using in-context learning, and (2) automating defense mechanisms by testing these attacks against a vulnerable application secured by a WAF, classifying bypassing attacks, and generating effective WAF security rules. Experimental results using GPT-4o demonstrate the framework's effectiveness generating 264 XSS payloads, 83% of which were validated, with 80% bypassing ModSecurity WAF equipped with an industry standard security rule set developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to protect against web vulnerabilities.

It iteratively generates web queries, collects information, summarizes findings, and refines subsequent searches through reflection. By shifting away from static references, TALE aligns with free-form question-answering tasks common in real-world scenarios.

To help address this gap, this paper explores the use of LLMs for generating executable acceptance tests for web applications through a two-step process: (i) generating acceptance test scenarios in natural language (in Gherkin) from user stories, and (ii) converting these scenarios into executable test scripts (in Cypress), knowing the HTML code of the pages under test. This two-step approach supports acceptance test-driven development, enhances tester control, and improves test quality.

However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the \textit{data compliance gap}
 (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.","Submitted 8 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

In this article, we present the first study utilizing registers (also known as genres) - a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation - to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the performance of LLMs. We perform comparative studies by training models with register classified data and evaluating them using standard benchmarks, and show that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar performance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts such as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained on the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited to a single register, combining well-performing registers like How-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major improvements.

Our results depict a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results. This gap can be attributed to shortcomings in existing benchmarks. We introduce Online-Mind2Web, an online evaluation benchmark consisting of 300 diverse and realistic tasks spanning 136 websites. It enables us to evaluate web agents under a setting that approximates how real users use these agents. To facilitate more scalable evaluation and development, we also develop a novel LLM-as-a-Judge automatic evaluation method and show that it can achieve around 85% agreement with human judgment, substantially higher than existing methods. Finally, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of current web agents, highlighting both their strengths and limitations to inspire future research.","Submitted 24 May, 2025; v1 submitted 2 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions. We highlighted practical implications of incorporating web search functionality into LLMs in real-world contexts.","Submitted 6 May, 2025; v1 submitted 1 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

However, translating SQL queries between different dialects (e.g., from PostgreSQL to MySQL) remains a challenging task due to syntactic discrepancies and subtle semantic variations. Existing approaches including manual rewriting, rule-based systems, and largelanguagemodel (LLM)-based techniques often involve high maintenance effort (e.g., crafting custom translation rules) or produce unreliable results (e.g., LLM generates non-existent functions), especially when handling complex queries. In this demonstration, we present CrackSQL, the first hybrid SQL dialect translation system that combines rule and LLM-based methods to overcome these limitations. CrackSQL leverages the adaptability of LLMs to minimize manual intervention, while enhancing translation accuracy by segmenting lengthy complex SQL via functionality-based query processing. To further improve robustness, it incorporates a novel cross-dialect syntax embedding model for precise syntax alignment, as well as an adaptive local-to-global translation strategy that effectively resolves interdependent query operations. CrackSQL supports three translation modes and offers multiple deployment and access options including a web console interface, a PyPI package, and a command-line prompt, facilitating adoption across a variety of real-world use cases","Submitted 1 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

In cybersecurity education, where accuracy and safety are paramount, systems must go beyond surface-level relevance to provide information that is both trustworthy and domain-appropriate. To address this challenge, we introduce CyberBOT, a question-answering chatbot that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to incorporate contextual information from course-specific materials and validate responses using a domain-specific cybersecurity ontology. The ontology serves as a structured reasoning layer that constrains and verifies LLM-generated answers, reducing the risk of misleading or unsafe guidance. CyberBOT has been deployed in a large graduate-level course at Arizona State University (ASU), where more than one hundred students actively engage with the system through a dedicated web-based platform. Computational evaluations in lab environments highlight the potential capacity of CyberBOT, and a forthcoming field study will evaluate its pedagogical impact. By integrating structured domain reasoning with modern generative capabilities, CyberBOT illustrates a promising direction for developing reliable and curriculum-aligned AI applications in specialized educational contexts.","Submitted 31 March, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

A time series regression analysis,"Chris Brogly, Connor McElroy","The release of advanced LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Copilot is changing the way text is created and may influence the content that we find on the web. This study investigated whether the release of these two popular LLMs coincided with a change in writing style in headlines and links on worldwide news websites. 175 NLP features were obtained for each text in a dataset of 451 million headlines/links. An interrupted time series analysis was applied for each of the 175 NLP features to evaluate whether there were any statistically significant sustained changes after the release dates of ChatGPT and/or Copilot. There were a total of 44 features that did not appear to have any significant sustained change after the release of ChatGPT/Copilot. A total of 91 other features did show significant change with ChatGPT and/or Copilot although significance with earlier control LLM release dates (GPT-1/2/3, Gopher) removed them from consideration. This initial analysis suggests these language models may have had a limited impact on the style of individual news headlines/links, with respect to only some NLP measures.","Submitted 1 April, 2025; v1 submitted 31 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23439,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23439,Speculative End-Turn Detector for Efficient Speech Chatbot Assistant,"Hyunjong Ok, Suho Yoo, Jaeho Lee","Spoken dialogue systems powered by largelanguagemodels have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding human speech and generating appropriate spoken responses. However, these systems struggle with end-turn detection (ETD) -- the ability to distinguish between user turn completion and hesitation. This limitation often leads to premature or delayed responses, disrupting the flow of spoken conversations. In this paper, we introduce the ETD Dataset, the first public dataset for end-turn detection. The ETD dataset consists of both synthetic speech data generated with text-to-speech models and real-world speech data collected from web sources. We also propose SpeculativeETD, a novel collaborative inference framework that balances efficiency and accuracy to improve real-time ETD in resource-constrained environments. Our approach jointly employs a lightweight GRU-based model, which rapidly detects the non-speaking units in real-time on local devices, and a high-performance Wav2vec-based model running on the server to make a more challenging classification of distinguishing turn ends from mere pauses. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SpeculativeETD significantly improves ETD accuracy while keeping the required computations low. Datasets and code will be available after the review.","Submitted 30 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025."
https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23299,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23299,GRASP: Municipal Budget AI Chatbots for Enhancing Civic Engagement,"Jerry Xu, Justin Wang, Joley Leung, Jasmine Gu","There are a growing number of AI applications, but none tailored specifically to help residents answer their questions about municipal budget, a topic most are interested in but few have a solid comprehension of. In this research paper, we propose GRASP, a custom AI chatbot framework which stands for Generation with Retrieval and Action System for Prompts. GRASP provides more truthful and grounded responses to user budget queries than traditional information retrieval systems like general LargeLanguageModels (LLMs) or web searches. These improvements come from the novel combination of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework (""Generation with Retrieval"") and an agentic workflow (""Action System""), as well as prompt engineering techniques, the incorporation of municipal budget domain knowledge, and collaboration with local town officials to ensure response truthfulness. During testing, we found that our GRASP chatbot provided precise and accurate responses for local municipal budget queries 78% of the time, while GPT-4o and Gemini were only accurate 60% and 35% of the time, respectively. GRASP chatbots greatly reduce the time and effort needed for the general public to get an intuitive and correct understanding of their town's budget, thus fostering greater communal discourse, improving government transparency, and allowing citizens to make more informed decisions.","Submitted 29 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025."
