https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02529,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02529,Automated Web Application Testing: End-to-End Test Case Generation with Large Language Models and Screen Transition Graphs,"Nguyen-Khang Le, Quan Minh Bui, Minh Ngoc Nguyen, Hiep Nguyen, Trung Vo, Son T. Luu, Shoshin Nomura, Minh Le Nguyen","Web applications are critical to modern software ecosystems, yet ensuring their reliability remains challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature of web interfaces. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating complex tasks, but limitations persist in handling dynamic navigation flows and complex form interactions. This paper presents an automated system for generating test cases for two key aspects of web application testing: site navigation and form filling. For site navigation, the system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating form-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in improving testcoverage and robustness, advancing the state of web application testing.",originally announced June 2025.
https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00520,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00520,Temac: Multi-Agent Collaboration for Automated Web GUI Testing,"Chenxu Liu, Zhiyu Gu, Guoquan Wu, Ying Zhang, Jun Wei, Tao Xie","Quality assurance of web applications is critical, as web applications play an essential role in people's daily lives. To reduce labor costs, automated web GUI testing (AWGT) is widely adopted, exploring web applications via GUI actions such as clicks and text inputs. However, these approaches face limitations in generating continuous and meaningful action sequences capable of covering complex functionalities. Recent work incorporates large language models (LLMs) for GUI testing. However, these approaches face various challenges, including low efficiency of LLMs, high complexity of rich web application contexts, and a low success rate of LLMs in executing GUI tasks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Temac, an approach that enhances AWGT using LLM-based multi-agent collaboration to increase code coverage. Temac is motivated by our insight that LLMs can enhance AWGT in executing complex functionalities, while the information discovered during AWGT can, in turn, be provided as the domain knowledge to improve the LLM-based task execution. Specifically, given a web application, Temac initially runs an existing approach to broadly explore application states. When the testingcoverage stagnates, Temac then employs LLM-based agents to summarize the collected information to form a knowledge base and to infer not-covered functionalities. Guided by this knowledge base, Temac finally uses specialized LLM-based agents to target and execute the not-covered functionalities, reaching deeper states beyond those explored by the existing approach. Our evaluation results show that Temac exceeds state-of-the-art approaches from 12.5% to 60.3% on average code coverage on six complex open-source web applications, while revealing 445 unique failures in the top 20 real-world web applications. These results strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and the general applicability of Temac.",originally announced June 2025.
https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15079,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15079,LogiAgent: Automated Logical Testing for REST Systems with LLM-Based Multi-Agents,"Ke Zhang, Chenxi Zhang, Chong Wang, Chi Zhang, YaChen Wu, Zhenchang Xing, Yang Liu, Qingshan Li, Xin Peng","Automated testing for REST APIs has become essential for ensuring the correctness and reliability of modern web services. While existing approaches primarily focus on detecting server crashes and error codes, they often overlook logical issues that arise due to evolving business logic and domain-specific requirements. To address this limitation, we propose LogiAgent, a novel approach for logical testing of REST systems. Built upon a large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent framework, LogiAgent integrates a Test Scenario Generator, API Request Executor, and API Response Validator to collaboratively generate, execute, and validate API test scenarios. Unlike traditional testing methods that focus on status codes like 5xx, LogiAgent incorporates logical oracles that assess responses based on business logic, ensuring more comprehensive testing. The system is further enhanced by an Execution Memory component that stores historical API execution data for contextual consistency. We conduct extensive experiments across 12 real-world REST systems, demonstrating that LogiAgent effectively identifies 234 logical issues with an accuracy of 66.19%. Additionally, it basically excels in detecting server crashes and achieves superior testcoverage compared to four state-of-the-art REST API testing tools. An ablation study confirms the significant contribution of LogiAgent's memory components to improving testcoverage.",originally announced March 2025.
