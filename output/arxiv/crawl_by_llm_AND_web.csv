This study provides a systematic review of selected empirical studies on LLMs in computer programming education, published from 2023 to March 2024. The data for this review were collected from Web of Science (SCI/SSCI), SCOPUS, and EBSCOhost databases, as well as three conference proceedings specialized in computer programming education. In total, 42 studies met the selection criteria and were reviewed using methods, including bibliometric analysis, thematic analysis, and structural topic modeling. This study offers an overview of the current state of LLMs in computer programming education research. It outlines LLMs' applications, benefits, limitations, concerns, and implications for future research and practices, establishing connections between LLMs and their practical use in computer programming education. This review also provides examples and valuable insights for instructional designers, instructors, and learners. Additionally, a conceptual framework is proposed to guide education practitioners in integrating LLMs into computer programming education. This study suggests future research directions from various perspectives, emphasizing the need to expand research methods and topics in computer programming education as LLMs evolve. Additionally, future research in the field should incorporate collaborative, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary efforts on a large scale, focusing on longitudinal research and development initiatives.","Submitted 13 April, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

In this work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes, such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions, evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%, -1.61\%
 compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.","Submitted 17 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

Bosse, Daniel Hnyk, Peter Mühlbacher, Finn Hambly, Jon Evans, Dan Schwarz, Lawrence Phillips","Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a ""pastcasting"" benchmark with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic ""forecasts"" on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing training data cutoff dates.

This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence. DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases.

Determining the most probable condition among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks. Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence. Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility in clinical settings.

These systems transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational depth on reasoning and search.

Traditionally, students ask instructors or search dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings, subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic writing.","Submitted 22 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

Jamil","The exponential growth of scientific literature challenges researchers extracting and synthesizing knowledge. Traditional search engines return many sources without direct, detailed answers, while general-purpose LLMs may offer concise responses that lack depth or omit current information. LLMs with search capabilities are also limited by context window, yielding short, incomplete answers. This paper introduces WISE (Workflow for Intelligent Scientific Knowledge Extraction), a system addressing these limits by using a structured workflow to extract, refine, and rank query-specific knowledge. WISE uses an LLM-powered, tree-based architecture to refine data, focusing on query-aligned, context-aware, and non-redundant information. Dynamic scoring and ranking prioritize unique contributions from each source, and adaptive stopping criteria minimize processing overhead. WISE delivers detailed, organized answers by systematically exploring and synthesizing knowledge from diverse sources. Experiments on HBB gene-associated diseases demonstrate WISE reduces processed text by over 80% while achieving significantly higher recall over baselines like search engines and other LLM-based approaches. ROUGE and BLEU metrics reveal WISE's output is more unique than other systems, and a novel level-based metric shows it provides more in-depth information. We also explore how the WISE workflow can be adapted for diverse domains like drug discovery, material science, and social science, enabling efficient knowledge extraction and synthesis from unstructured scientific papers and web sources.","Submitted 21 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

Due to the stateless nature of large language models (LLMs), these agents rely heavily on external memory systems to maintain context across interactions. Unlike centralized systems where context is securely stored server-side, agent memory is often managed client-side or by third-party applications, creating significant security vulnerabilities. This was recently exploited to attack production systems. We introduce and formalize ""plan injection,"" a novel context manipulation attack that corrupts these agents' internal task representations by targeting this vulnerable context. Through systematic evaluation of two popular web agents, Browser-use and Agent-E, we show that plan injections bypass robust prompt injection defenses, achieving up to 3x higher attack success rates than comparable prompt-based attacks. Furthermore, ""context-chained injections,"" which craft logical bridges between legitimate user goals and attacker objectives, lead to a 17.7% increase in success rate for privacy exfiltration tasks.

A Comparative Study on Issue Identification in Heuristic Evaluation,"Guilherme Guerino, Luiz Rodrigues, Bruna Capeleti, Rafael Ferreira Mello, André Freire, Luciana Zaina","Heuristic evaluation is a widely used method in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to inspect interfaces and identify issues based on heuristics. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o, have been applied in HCI to assist in persona creation, the ideation process, and the analysis of semi-structured interviews. However, considering the need to understand heuristics and the high degree of abstraction required to evaluate them, LLMs may have difficulty conducting heuristic evaluation. However, prior research has not investigated GPT-4o's performance in heuristic evaluation compared to HCI experts in web-based systems. In this context, this study aims to compare the results of a heuristic evaluation performed by GPT-4o and human experts. To this end, we selected a set of screenshots from a web system and asked GPT-4o to perform a heuristic evaluation based on Nielsen's Heuristics from a literature-grounded prompt. Our results indicate that only 21.2% of the issues identified by human experts were also identified by GPT-4o, despite it found 27 new issues. We also found that GPT-4o performed better for heuristics related to aesthetic and minimalist design and match between system and real world, whereas it has difficulty identifying issues in heuristics related to flexibility, control, and user efficiency. Additionally, we noticed that GPT-4o generated several false positives due to hallucinations and attempts to predict issues.

Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information. To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA, open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes beyond the training horizon.

These issues hinder the accurate assessment of model performance. To address these challenges, we present FrontendBench, a benchmark co-developed by humans and LLMs. FrontendBench categorizes tasks based on code functionality and incorporates interactive test scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of front-end code generation capabilities. The benchmark comprises 148 meticulously crafted prompt-test case pairs spanning five levels of web components, from basic UI elements to complex interactive features. Each task reflects realistic front-end development challenges. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that executes generated code within a sandbox environment and assesses outcomes using predefined test scripts. This framework achieves a 90.54% agreement rate with expert human evaluations, demonstrating high reliability. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on FrontendBench and observe substantial performance disparities in handling real-world front-end tasks. These results highlight FrontendBench as a reliable and scalable benchmark, supporting consistent multimodal evaluation and providing a robust foundation for future research in front-end code generation. Our data and code will be released soon.","Submitted 18 June, 2025; v1 submitted 15 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

Natural language processing technologies, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), have been widely applied to climate change-specific research, providing essential information support for decision-makers and the public. Some studies have improved model performance on relevant tasks by constructing climate change-related instruction data and instruction-tuning LLMs. However, current research remains inadequate in efficiently producing large volumes of high-precision instruction data for climate change, which limits further development of climate change LLMs. This study introduces an automated method for constructing instruction data. The method generates instructions using facts and background knowledge from documents and enhances the diversity of the instruction data through web scraping and the collection of seed instructions. Using this method, we constructed a climate change instruction dataset, named ClimateChat-Corpus, which was used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, resulting in an LLM named ClimateChat. Evaluation results show that ClimateChat significantly improves performance on climate change question-and-answer tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of different base models and instruction data on LLM performance and demonstrated its capability to adapt to a wide range of climate change scientific discovery tasks, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate base model for instruction tuning. This research provides valuable references and empirical support for constructing climate change instruction data and training climate change-specific LLMs.","Submitted 12 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

This paper aims to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of privacy in LLMs, categorizing the challenges into four main areas: (i) privacy issues in LLM training data, (ii) privacy challenges associated with user prompts, (iii) privacy vulnerabilities in LLM-generated outputs, and (iv) privacy challenges involving LLM agents.

However, most current methods lack mechanisms for coordinating specialized agents and have limited ability to generalize to new or diverse domains. We introduce \projectname, a hierarchical multi-agent framework for general-purpose task solving that integrates high-level planning with modular agent collaboration. Inspired by the way a conductor orchestrates a symphony and guided by the principles of \textit{extensibility}, \textit{multimodality}, \textit{modularity}, and \textit{coordination}, \projectname features a central planning agent that decomposes complex objectives and delegates sub-tasks to a team of specialized agents. Each sub-agent is equipped with general programming and analytical tools, as well as abilities to tackle a wide range of real-world specific tasks, including data analysis, file operations, web navigation, and interactive reasoning in dynamic multimodal environments. \projectname supports flexible orchestration through explicit sub-goal formulation, inter-agent communication, and adaptive role allocation. We evaluate the framework on three widely used benchmark datasets covering various real-world tasks, searching web pages, reasoning over heterogeneous modalities, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that \projectname consistently outperforms flat-agent and monolithic baselines in task success rate and adaptability.

However, the classical OSI model-designed for deterministic and error-tolerant systems-cannot support quantum-specific phenomena such as coherence fragility, probabilistic entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and proposes an architectural redesign of the OSI model for quantum networks in the context of 7G. We introduce a Quantum-Converged OSI stack by extending the classical model with Layer 0 (Quantum Substrate) and Layer 8 (Cognitive Intent), supporting entanglement, teleportation, and semantic orchestration via LLMs and QML. Each layer is redefined to incorporate quantum mechanisms such as enhanced MAC protocols, fidelity-aware routing, and twin-based applications. This survey consolidates over 150 research works from IEEE, ACM, MDPI, arXiv, and Web of Science (2018-2025), classifying them by OSI layer, enabling technologies such as QKD, QEC, PQC, and RIS, and use cases such as satellite QKD, UAV swarms, and quantum IoT. A taxonomy of cross-layer enablers-such as hybrid quantum-classical control, metadata-driven orchestration, and blockchain-integrated quantum trust-is provided, along with simulation tools including NetSquid, QuNetSim, and QuISP. We present several domain-specific applications, including quantum healthcare telemetry, entangled vehicular networks, and satellite mesh overlays.

Consequently, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is being shifted into Conversational Search Engine Optimization (C-SEO).

However, they are often tested only for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains. Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains, and number of actors.

Our experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective, contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM context, are significantly more effective.

Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions. This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research: rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface (AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety, efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving the broader ML community.","Submitted 12 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing novel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first address alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually curated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines training data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes instruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly improving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods. Next, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We develop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages meta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates. Furthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a refinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures token-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment across QA and mathematical reasoning tasks. Finally, we tackle the challenge of evaluating alignment. Existing benchmarks emphasize response quality but overlook adherence to specific constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce FollowBench, a multi-level, fine-grained benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to follow complex constraints across diverse instruction types.

In addition, we introduce the task-aligned injection technique that frame malicious commands as helpful task guidance rather than obvious attacks. This technique exploiting fundamental limitations in LLMs' contextual reasoning: agents struggle in maintaining coherent contextual awareness and fail to detect when seemingly helpful web content contains steering attempts that deviate from their original task goal.

Topol, Jure Leskovec, Michael Moor","LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw, unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs, each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering, grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval. Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover, MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to 37% (increase in F1 score).

Building on this structured design space, we introduce a predictive value model that estimates agent performance given agentic system and task description, allowing for efficient, low-cost evaluation during the search process. Finally, we present a hierarchical Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy informed by uncertainty to guide the search. Experiments on seven benchmarks, covering embodied, math, web, tool, and game, show that our method achieves an average performance gain of 8.34\% over state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits faster search progress with steeper improvement trajectories.

While LLMs have shown promising capabilities in generating ``believable'' human behaviors, evaluating their ability to mimic real user behaviors remains an open challenge, largely due to the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets that capture both the observable actions and the internal reasoning of an actual human user. To address this gap, we introduce OPERA, a novel dataset of Observation, Persona, Rationale, and Action collected from real human participants during online shopping sessions. OPERA is the first public dataset that comprehensively captures: user personas, browser observations, fine-grained web actions, and self-reported just-in-time rationales. We developed both an online questionnaire and a custom browser plugin to gather this dataset with high fidelity. Using OPERA, we establish the first benchmark to evaluate how well current LLMs can predict a specific user's next action and rationale with a given persona and <observation, action, rationale> history.

However, analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn, fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around 12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources, revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however, the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on the model's parametric knowledge.

To address these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs, while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource datasets.

While there are methods capable of generating synthetic instructions at scale, they either suffer from limited grounding sources, leading to a narrow distribution, or rely on trivial extensions that fail to produce meaningful trajectories in terms of complexity. In contrast, instructions that benefit efficient alignment are typically crafted with cognitive insights and grounded in real-world use cases. In this paper, we synthesize such instructions using attributed grounding, which involves 1) a top-down attribution process that grounds a selective set of real instructions to situated users, and 2) a bottom-up synthesis process that leverages web documents to first generate a situation, then a meaningful instruction. This framework allows us to harvest diverse and complex instructions at scale, utilizing the vast range of web documents.

Traditional detection approaches rely on machine learning classifiers or rule-based scanners operating in the cloud, but these face significant challenges in generalization, privacy, and evasion by sophisticated threats. In this paper, we propose a novel client-side framework for comprehensive URL analysis that leverages zero-shot inference by a local large language model (LLM) running entirely in-browser. Our system uses a compact LLM (e.g., 3B/8B parameters) via WebLLM to perform reasoning over rich context collected from the target webpage, including static code analysis (JavaScript abstract syntax trees, structure, and code patterns), dynamic sandbox execution results (DOM changes, API calls, and network requests),and visible content. We detail the architecture and methodology of the system, which combines a real browser sandbox (using iframes) resistant to common anti-analysis techniques, with an LLM-based analyzer that assesses potential vulnerabilities and malicious behaviors without any task-specific training (zero-shot). The LLM aggregates evidence from multiple sources (code, execution trace, page content) to classify the URL as benign or malicious and to provide an explanation of the threats or security issues identified. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of benign and malicious URLs, demonstrating that even a compact client-side model can achieve high detection accuracy and insightful explanations comparable to cloud-based solutions, while operating privately on end-user devices. The results show that client-side LLM inference is a feasible and effective solution to web threat analysis, eliminating the need to send potentially sensitive data to cloud services.","Submitted 4 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

Despite the promise of feedback-driven improvement, the stability of agentic workflows rests on the reliability of the judge. However, judges may hallucinate information, exhibit bias, or act adversarially -- introducing critical vulnerabilities into the workflow. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of agentic workflows under deceptive or misleading feedback. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for analyzing judge behavior, along axes of intent (from constructive to malicious) and knowledge (from parametric-only to retrieval-augmented systems). Using this taxonomy, we construct a suite of judge behaviors and develop WAFER-QA, a new benchmark with critiques grounded in retrieved web evidence to evaluate robustness of agentic workflows against factually supported adversarial feedback. We reveal that even strongest agents are vulnerable to persuasive yet flawed critiques -- often switching correct answers after a single round of misleading feedback. Taking a step further, we study how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction, revealing distinct behavioral patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning models.

As web agents become increasingly capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks. WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory across multiple webpages.

Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model behavior. Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks.","Submitted 2 June, 2025; originally announced June 2025."

However, MLAs introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy.

Large-scale experiments involving 13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks.

We reformulate 3D animation as a field prediction task and introduce a text-driven framework that infers a time-varying 4D flow field acting on 3D Gaussians.

This design avoids overheads such as mesh extraction, manual or physics-based simulations and allows both novice and expert users to animate volumetric scenes with minimal effort on a consumer device even in a web browser. Experimental results show that simple textual instructions suffice to generate compelling time-varying VFX, reducing the manual effort typically required for rigging or advanced modeling.

To reduce labor costs, automated web GUI testing (AWGT) is widely adopted, exploring web applications via GUI actions such as clicks and text inputs. However, these approaches face limitations in generating continuous and meaningful action sequences capable of covering complex functionalities. Recent work incorporates large language models (LLMs) for GUI testing. However, these approaches face various challenges, including low efficiency of LLMs, high complexity of rich web application contexts, and a low success rate of LLMs in executing GUI tasks. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Temac, an approach that enhances AWGT using LLM-based multi-agent collaboration to increase code coverage. Temac is motivated by our insight that LLMs can enhance AWGT in executing complex functionalities, while the information discovered during AWGT can, in turn, be provided as the domain knowledge to improve the LLM-based task execution. Specifically, given a web application, Temac initially runs an existing approach to broadly explore application states. When the testing coverage stagnates, Temac then employs LLM-based agents to summarize the collected information to form a knowledge base and to infer not-covered functionalities. Guided by this knowledge base, Temac finally uses specialized LLM-based agents to target and execute the not-covered functionalities, reaching deeper states beyond those explored by the existing approach.

In several past years neural networks models such as YOLOv11 and Detectron2 have revolutionized visual data analysis, but their application to domain-specific cultural artifacts - such as manuscripts and incunabula - remains limited by the absence of methodologies that address structural feature extraction and semantic interoperability. In this position paper, we argue, that the integration of neural networks with semantic technologies represents a paradigm shift in cultural heritage digitization processes. We present the Metadata Enrichment Model (MEM), a conceptual framework designed to enrich metadata for digitized collections by combining fine-tuned computer vision models, large language models (LLMs) and structured knowledge graphs. The Multilayer Vision Mechanism (MVM) appears as the key innovation of MEM. This iterative process improves visual analysis by dynamically detecting nested features, such as text within seals or images within stamps. To expose MEM's potential, we apply it to a dataset of digitized incunabula from the Jagiellonian Digital Library and release a manually annotated dataset of 105 manuscript pages. We examine the practical challenges of MEM's usage in real-world GLAM institutions, including the need for domain-specific fine-tuning, the adjustment of enriched metadata with Linked Data standards and computational costs. We present MEM as a flexible and extensible methodology. This paper contributes to the discussion on how artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies can advance cultural heritage research, and also use these technologies in practice.","Submitted 29 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

LLMs, being trained at web-scale, have the conversion process and many instances of Primal to Dual Conversion (P2DC) at their disposal. Students may thus reasonably expect that LLMs would perform well on the P2DC task. To assess this expectation, this paper introduces DualSchool, a comprehensive framework for generating and verifying P2DC instances. The verification procedure of DualSchool uses the Canonical Graph Edit Distance, going well beyond existing evaluation methods for optimization models, which exhibit many false positives and negatives when applied to P2DC. Experiments performed by DualSchool reveal interesting findings. Although LLMs can recite the conversion procedure accurately, state-of-the-art open LLMs fail to consistently produce correct duals.

These agents interact with environment through intermediate interfaces, such as predefined action spaces and interaction rules, which mediate the perception and action. However, mismatches often happen between the internal expectations of the agent regarding the influence of its issued actions and the actual state transitions in the environment, a phenomenon referred to as \textbf{agent-environment misalignment}. While prior work has invested substantially in improving agent strategies and environment design, the critical role of the interface still remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that agent-environment misalignment poses a significant bottleneck to agent performance. To mitigate this issue, we propose \textbf{ALIGN}, an \underline{A}uto-A\underline{l}igned \underline{I}nterface \underline{G}e\underline{n}eration framework that alleviates the misalignment by enriching the interface. Specifically, the ALIGN-generated interface enhances both the static information of the environment and the step-wise observations returned to the agent. Implemented as a lightweight wrapper, this interface achieves the alignment without modifying either the agent logic or the environment code. Experiments across multiple domains including embodied tasks, web navigation and tool-use, show consistent performance improvements, with up to a 45.67\% success rate improvement observed in ALFWorld. Meanwhile, ALIGN-generated interface can generalize across different agent architectures and LLM backbones without interface regeneration.

In this paper, we show that when training LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense datasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data (arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit phase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size. Through controlled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped data, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical value, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the biographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost nothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly memorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity allocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack problem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation across datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio varies. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and reveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing ratio following a power-law relationship with the model size. Our findings highlight a concrete case where a good mixing recipe for large models may not be optimal for small models, and vice versa.","Submitted 23 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

This makes fair comparison between traditional algorithmic techniques, which rely on structural heuristics, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches, offering zero-shot extraction across diverse layouts, particularly challenging. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a concrete evaluation framework. Our framework systematically generates evaluation datasets from arbitrary MHTML snapshots, annotates XPath-based supervision labels, and employs structure-aware metrics for consistent scoring, specifically preventing text hallucination and allowing only for the assessment of positional hallucination. It also incorporates preprocessing strategies to optimize input for LLMs while preserving DOM semantics: HTML slimming, Hierarchical JSON, and Flat JSON. Additionally, we created a publicly available synthetic dataset by transforming DOM structures and modifying content. We benchmark deterministic heuristic algorithms and off-the-shelf LLMs across these multiple input formats. Our benchmarking shows that Flat JSON input enables LLMs to achieve superior extraction accuracy (F1 score of 0.9567) and minimal hallucination compared to other input formats like Slimmed HTML and Hierarchical JSON. We establish a standardized foundation for rigorous benchmarking, paving the way for the next principled advancements in web data record extraction.","Submitted 21 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Recently, LLMs have been used to synthesize instruction data using seed question-answer (QA) pairs. However, these synthesized instructions often lack diversity and tend to be similar to the input seeds, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose extracting instruction tuning data from web corpora that contain rich and diverse knowledge. A naive solution is to retrieve domain-specific documents and extract all QA pairs from them, but this faces two key challenges: (1) extracting all QA pairs using LLMs is prohibitively expensive, and (2) many extracted QA pairs may be irrelevant to the downstream tasks, potentially degrading model performance. To tackle these issues, we introduce EQUAL, an effective and scalable data extraction framework that iteratively alternates between document selection and high-quality QA pair extraction to enhance instruction tuning. EQUAL first clusters the document corpus based on embeddings derived from contrastive learning, then uses a multi-armed bandit strategy to efficiently identify clusters that are likely to contain valuable QA pairs.

This paper presents Telco-oRAG, an open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework optimized for answering technical questions in the telecommunications domain, with a particular focus on 3GPP standards. Telco-oRAG introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy that combines 3GPP domain-specific retrieval with web search, supported by glossary-enhanced query refinement and a neural router for memory-efficient retrieval. Our results show that Telco-oRAG improves the accuracy in answering 3GPP-related questions by up to 17.6% and achieves a 10.6% improvement in lexicon queries compared to baselines. Furthermore, Telco-oRAG reduces memory usage by 45% through targeted retrieval of relevant 3GPP series compared to baseline RAG, and enables open-source LLMs to reach GPT-4-level accuracy on telecom benchmarks.","Submitted 17 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

To address this challenge, we propose Terminators, a modular agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to parse and audit ToS documents. Rather than treating ToS understanding as a black-box summarization problem, Terminators breaks the task down to three interpretable steps: term extraction, verification, and accountability planning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the OpenAI ToS using GPT-4o, highlighting strategies to minimize hallucinations and maximize auditability. Our results suggest that structured, agent-based LLM workflows can enhance both the usability and enforceability of complex legal documents. By translating opaque terms into actionable, verifiable components, Terminators promotes ethical use of web content by enabling greater transparency, empowering users to understand their digital rights, and supporting automated policy audits for regulatory or civic oversight.","Submitted 16 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

We are now witnessing the emergence of \emph{Computer-Using Agents} (CUAs), capable of autonomously performing tasks such as navigating desktop applications, web pages, and mobile apps. However, as these agents grow in capability, they also introduce novel safety and security risks. Vulnerabilities in LLM-driven reasoning, with the added complexity of integrating multiple software components and multimodal inputs, further complicate the security landscape. In this paper, we present a systematization of knowledge on the safety and security threats of CUAs. We conduct a comprehensive literature review and distill our findings along four research objectives: \textit{\textbf{(i)}} define the CUA that suits safety analysis; \textit{\textbf{(ii)} } categorize current safety threats among CUAs; \textit{\textbf{(iii)}} propose a comprehensive taxonomy of existing defensive strategies; \textit{\textbf{(iv)}} summarize prevailing benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics used to assess the safety and performance of CUAs.

However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work is often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of transferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical experts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm identification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8 practitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design choices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by non-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to support mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without scaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google Docs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint harm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to align understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based prototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively facilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the early design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft development plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through stage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface potential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO increased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline worksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts made harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more collaborative RAI practices in early design.","Submitted 15 May, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Key phenomenon for UCs include agents' deficiencies in comprehending instructions and planning tasks, challenges in executing accurate GUI interactions and adapting to dynamic interfaces, the generation of unreliable or misaligned outputs, and shortcomings in error handling and feedback processing. These phenomena manifest as influences from unanticipated actions and user frustration, to privacy violations and security vulnerabilities, and further to eroded trust and wider ethical concerns.

However, traditional retrieval-augmented generation methods employ static, pre-inference retrieval strategies, making them inadequate for complex tasks involving ambiguous, multi-step, or evolving information needs. Recent advances in test-time scaling techniques have demonstrated significant potential in enabling LLMs to dynamically interact with external tools, motivating the shift toward adaptive inference-time retrieval. Inspired by Information Foraging Theory (IFT), we propose InForage, a reinforcement learning framework that formalizes retrieval-augmented reasoning as a dynamic information-seeking process. Unlike existing approaches, InForage explicitly rewards intermediate retrieval quality, encouraging LLMs to iteratively gather and integrate information through adaptive search behaviors. To facilitate training, we construct a human-guided dataset capturing iterative search and reasoning trajectories for complex, real-world web tasks. Extensive evaluations across general question answering, multi-hop reasoning tasks, and a newly developed real-time web QA dataset demonstrate InForage's superior performance over baseline methods.

In the realm of well-known languages, intent detection predictors utilize the strategy of few-shot learning and prediction of unseen classes based on the model training on seen classes. However, Urdu language lacks few-shot strategy based intent detection predictors and traditional predictors are focused on prediction of the same classes which models have seen in the train set. To empower Urdu language specific intent detection, this introduces a unique contrastive learning approach that leverages unlabeled Urdu data to re-train pre-trained language models. This re-training empowers LLMs representation learning for the downstream intent detection task. Finally, it reaps the combined potential of pre-trained LLMs and the prototype-informed attention mechanism to create a comprehensive end-to-end LLMPIA intent detection pipeline.

Early LLM code benchmarks primarily focused on code generation accuracy, but these benchmarks have gradually become saturated. Benchmark saturation weakens their guiding role for LLMs. For example, HumanEval Pass@1 has reached 99.4% and MBPP 94.2%. Among various attempts to address benchmark saturation, approaches based on software engineering have stood out, but the saturation of existing software engineering benchmarks is rapidly increasing. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, Web-Bench, which contains 50 projects, each consisting of 20 tasks with sequential dependencies. The tasks implement project features in sequence, simulating real-world human development workflows.

The framework incorporates three major innovations: (1) de-noising parliamentary speeches via summarization to produce cleaner, more consistent opinion embeddings; (2) automatic extraction of axes of political controversy from legislators' speech summaries; and (3) a diachronic analysis that tracks the evolution of party positions over time. We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations to verify our methodology. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate high correlation with expert predictions across various political topics, while qualitative analyses reveal meaningful associations between language patterns and political ideologies.

We propose AutoLibra, a framework for agent evaluation, that transforms open-ended human feedback, e.g., ""If you find that the button is disabled, don't click it again"", or ""This agent has too much autonomy to decide what to do on its own"", into metrics for evaluating fine-grained behaviors in agent trajectories. AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta-metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: ""coverage"" and ""redundancy"". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra-induced metrics serve as better prompt-engineering targets than the task success rate on a wide range of text game tasks, improving agent performance over baseline by a mean of 20%.

Furthermore, criticism argues that the Turing Test primarily assesses deceptive mimicry rather than genuine intelligence, prompting the continuous emergence of alternative benchmarks. This study argues against discarding the Turing Test, proposing instead using more refined versions of it, for example, by interacting simultaneously with both an AI and human candidate to determine who is who, allowing a longer interaction duration, access to the Internet and other AIs, using experienced people as evaluators, etc. Through systematic experimentation using a web-based platform, we demonstrate that richer, contextually structured testing environments significantly enhance participants' ability to differentiate between AI and human interactions. Namely, we show that, while an off-the-shelf LLM can pass some version of a Turing Test, it fails to do so when faced with a more robust version.

While these datasets provide linguistic data essential for high-quality natural language generation, they often contain harmful content, such as hate speech, misinformation, and biased narratives. Training LLMs on such unfiltered data risks perpetuating toxic behaviors, spreading misinformation, and amplifying societal biases which can undermine trust in LLM-driven applications and raise ethical concerns about their use. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of inappropriate content across these datasets, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes harmful webpages into Topical and Toxic based on their intent. We also introduce a prompt evaluation dataset, a high-accuracy Topical and Toxic Prompt (TTP), and a transformer-based model (HarmFormer) for harmful content filtering. Additionally, we create a new multi-harm open-ended toxicity benchmark (HAVOC) and provide crucial insights into how models respond to adversarial toxic inputs. We share TTP, TTP-Eval, HAVOC and a sample of C4 inferenced on HarmFormer.

(2 additional authors not shown)","Information on the web, such as scientific publications and Wikipedia, often surpasses users' reading level. To help address this, we used a self-refinement approach to develop a LLM capability for minimally lossy text simplification. To validate our approach, we conducted a randomized study involving 4563 participants and 31 texts spanning 6 broad subject areas: PubMed (biomedical scientific articles), biology, law, finance, literature/philosophy, and aerospace/computer science. Participants were randomized to viewing original or simplified texts in a subject area, and answered multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that tested their comprehension of the text. The participants were also asked to provide qualitative feedback such as task difficulty. Our results indicate that participants who read the simplified text answered more MCQs correctly than their counterparts who read the original text (3.9% absolute increase, p<0.05). This gain was most striking with PubMed (14.6%), while more moderate gains were observed for finance (5.5%), aerospace/computer science (3.8%) domains, and legal (3.5%). Notably, the results were robust to whether participants could refer back to the text while answering MCQs. The absolute accuracy decreased by up to ~9% for both original and simplified setups where participants could not refer back to the text, but the ~4% overall improvement persisted. Finally, participants' self-reported perceived ease based on a simplified NASA Task Load Index was greater for those who read the simplified text (absolute change on a 5-point scale 0.33, p<0.05).

A clear separation of private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context. Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs across 150 different user inboxes.

Existing accident data collection is largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination, dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning (8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection, providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.","Submitted 23 April, 2025; originally announced May 2025."

Despite decades of research, XSS remains among the top 10 security vulnerabilities. Researchers have proposed various techniques to protect systems from XSS attacks, with machine learning (ML) being one of the most widely used methods. An ML model is trained on a dataset to identify potential XSS threats, making its effectiveness highly dependent on the size and diversity of the training data. A variation of XSS is obfuscated XSS, where attackers apply obfuscation techniques to alter the code's structure, making it challenging for security systems to detect its malicious intent. Our study's random forest model was trained on traditional (non-obfuscated) XSS data achieved 99.8% accuracy. However, when tested against obfuscated XSS samples, accuracy dropped to 81.9%, underscoring the importance of training ML models with obfuscated data to improve their effectiveness in detecting XSS attacks. A significant challenge is to generate highly complex obfuscated code despite the availability of several public tools. These tools can only produce obfuscation up to certain levels of complexity. In our proposed system, we fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate complex obfuscated XSS payloads automatically. By transforming original XSS samples into diverse obfuscated variants, we create challenging training data for ML model evaluation. Our approach achieved a 99.5% accuracy rate with the obfuscated dataset. We also found that the obfuscated samples generated by the LLMs were 28.1% more complex than those created by other tools, significantly improving the model's ability to handle advanced XSS attacks and making it more effective for real-world application security.","Submitted 28 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

Ridwanul Islam","Road accidents pose significant concerns globally. They lead to large financial losses, injuries, disabilities, and societal challenges. Accurate and timely accident data is essential for predicting and mitigating these events. This paper presents a novel framework named 'Durghotona GPT' that integrates web scraping and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of comprehensive accident datasets from prominent national dailies in Bangladesh. The authors collected accident reports from three major newspapers: Prothom Alo, Dhaka Tribune, and The Daily Star. The collected news was then processed using the newest available LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Llama-3. The framework efficiently extracts relevant information, categorizes reports, and compiles detailed datasets. Thus, this framework overcomes limitations of manual data collection methods such as delays, errors, and communication gaps. The authors' evaluation demonstrates that Llama-3, an open-source model, performs comparably to GPT-4. It achieved 89% accuracy in the authors' evaluation. Therefore, it can be considered a cost-effective alternative for similar tasks. The results suggest that the framework developed by the authors can drastically enhance the quality and availability of accident data. As a result, it can support critical applications in traffic safety analysis, urban planning, and public health. The authors also developed an interface for 'Durghotona GPT' for ease of use as part of this paper.

Recent advancements, particularly in web environments, face a critical limitation: their performance will reach a stagnation point during autonomous learning cycles, hindering further improvement. We argue that this stems from limited exploration of the web environment and insufficient exploitation of pre-trained web knowledge in LLMs. To improve the performance of self-improvement, we propose a novel framework that introduces a co-evolving World Model LLM. This world model predicts the next observation based on the current observation and action within the web environment. Leveraging LLMs' pretrained knowledge of abundant web content, the World Model serves dual roles: (1) as a virtual web server generating self-instructed training data to continuously refine the agent's policy, and (2) as an imagination engine during inference, enabling look-ahead simulation to guide action selection for the agent LLM. Experiments in real-world web environments (Mind2Web-Live, WebVoyager, and GAIA-web) show a 10% performance gain over existing self-evolving agents, demonstrating the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, without using any distillation from more powerful close-sourced models.

However, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities and inability to distinguish between instructions and data content, LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. These attacks manipulate LLMs into deviating from the original input instructions and executing maliciously injected instructions within data content, such as web documents retrieved from search engines. Existing defense methods, including prompt-engineering and fine-tuning approaches, typically instruct models to follow the original input instructions while suppressing their tendencies to execute injected instructions. However, our experiments reveal that suppressing instruction-following tendencies is challenging. Through analyzing failure cases, we observe that although LLMs tend to respond to any recognized instructions, they are aware of which specific instructions they are executing and can correctly reference them within the original prompt. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel defense method that leverages, rather than suppresses, the instruction-following abilities of LLMs. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate responses that include both answers and their corresponding instruction references. Based on these references, we filter out answers not associated with the original input instructions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prompt-engineering baselines and achieves performance comparable to fine-tuning methods, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0 percent in some scenarios.

Although, many studies have explored browser bugs, a comparative study among the modern browsers generalizing the bug categories and their nature was still lacking. To fill this gap, we undertook an empirical investigation aimed at gaining insights into the prevalent bugs in Google Chromium and Mozilla Firefox as the representatives of modern web browsers.

However, VLMs are typically trained on massive web-scraped images, raising concerns over copyright infringement and privacy violations, and making data auditing increasingly urgent. Membership inference (MI), which determines whether a sample was used in training, has emerged as a key auditing technique, with promising results on open-source VLMs like LLaVA (AUC > 80%). In this work, we revisit these advances and uncover a critical issue: current MI benchmarks suffer from distribution shifts between member and non-member images, introducing shortcut cues that inflate MI performance. We further analyze the nature of these shifts and propose a principled metric based on optimal transport to quantify the distribution discrepancy. To evaluate MI in realistic settings, we construct new benchmarks with i.i.d. member and non-member images. Existing MI methods fail under these unbiased conditions, performing only marginally better than chance. Further, we explore the theoretical upper bound of MI by probing the Bayes Optimality within the VLM's embedding space and find the irreducible error rate remains high. Despite this pessimistic outlook, we analyze why MI for VLMs is particularly challenging and identify three practical scenarios--fine-tuning, access to ground-truth texts, and set-based inference--where auditing becomes feasible.

Web APIs that employ the REST style are known as RESTful (or REST) APIs. When using or testing a RESTful API, developers may need to employ its specification, which is often defined by open-source standards such as the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). However, it can be very time-consuming and error-prone to write and update these specifications, which may negatively impact the use of RESTful APIs, especially when the software requirements change. Many tools and methods have been proposed to solve this problem, such as Respector and Swagger Core. OAS generation can be regarded as a common text-generation task that creates a formal description of API endpoints derived from the source code. A potential solution for this may involve using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have strong capabilities in both code understanding and text generation. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach for generating the OASs of RESTful APIs using LLMs: LLM-based RESTful API-Specification Generation (LRASGen). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of LLMs and API source code to generate OASs for RESTful APIs. Compared with existing tools and methods, LRASGen can generate the OASs, even when the implementation is incomplete (with partial code, and/or missing annotations/comments, etc.). To evaluate the LRASGen performance, we conducted a series of empirical studies on 20 real-world RESTful APIs.

To tackle these challenges, we propose Web Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework for synthesizing high-quality instruction-tuning (IT) data directly from raw web documents with minimal assumptions. Leveraging the inherent diversity of raw web content, we conceptualize web reconstruction as an instruction-tuning data synthesis task via a novel dual-perspective paradigm--Web as Instruction and Web as Response--where each web document is designated as either an instruction or a response to trigger the reconstruction process. Comprehensive experiments show that datasets generated by WebR outperform state-of-the-art baselines by up to 16.65% across four instruction-following benchmarks. Notably, WebR demonstrates superior compatibility, data efficiency, and scalability, enabling enhanced domain adaptation with minimal effort.

Traditional search evaluation methods primarily rely on relevance labels, which assess how well retrieved documents match a user's query. However, relevance alone fails to capture a search system's effectiveness in helping users achieve their search goals, making usefulness a critical evaluation criterion. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach: LLM-generated usefulness labels, which incorporate both implicit and explicit user behavior signals to evaluate document usefulness. We propose Task-aware Rubric-based Usefulness Evaluation (TRUE), a rubric-driven evaluation method that employs iterative sampling and reasoning to model complex search behavior patterns. Our findings show that (i) LLMs can generate moderate usefulness labels by leveraging comprehensive search session history incorporating personalization and contextual understanding, and (ii) fine-tuned LLMs improve usefulness judgments when provided with structured search session contexts. Additionally, we examine whether LLMs can distinguish between relevance and usefulness, particularly in cases where this divergence impacts search success. We also conduct an ablation study to identify key metrics for accurate usefulness label generation, optimizing for token efficiency and cost-effectiveness in real-world applications. This study advances LLM-based usefulness evaluation by refining key user metrics, exploring LLM-generated label reliability, and ensuring feasibility for large-scale search systems.","Submitted 8 May, 2025; v1 submitted 19 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

We illustrate several advantages of our framework, including the ability to adapt to new threat models and environments easily, the ability to easily combine several previously published attacks to enable comprehensive and fine-grained security testing, and the ability to analyze trade-offs between various vulnerabilities and performance.

However, the generative nature of LLMs raises concerns about presenting misinformation as fact. To address this, we developed a web-based application that helps K-12 students enhance critical thinking by identifying misleading information in LLM responses about major historical figures. In this paper, we describe the implementation and design details of the DoYouTrustAI tool, which can be used to provide an interactive lesson which teaches students about the dangers of misinformation and how believable generative AI can make it seem. The DoYouTrustAI tool utilizes prompt engineering to present the user with AI generated summaries about the life of a historical figure. These summaries can be either accurate accounts of that persons life, or an intentionally misleading alteration of their history. The user is tasked with determining the validity of the statement without external resources. Our research questions for this work were:(RQ1) How can we design a tool that teaches students about the dangers of misleading information and of how misinformation can present itself in LLM responses? (RQ2) Can we present prompt engineering as a topic that is easily understandable for students? Our findings highlight the need to correct misleading information before users retain it. Our tool lets users select familiar individuals for testing to reduce random guessing and presents misinformation alongside known facts to maintain believability. It also provides pre-configured prompt instructions to show how different prompts affect AI responses.

Overcoming Detection Challenges with Behavioral Function-Aware Framework,"Feijiang Han, Jiaming Zhang, Chuyi Deng, Jianheng Tang, Yunhuai Liu","WebShell attacks, in which malicious scripts are injected into web servers, are a major cybersecurity threat. Traditional machine learning and deep learning methods are hampered by issues such as the need for extensive training data, catastrophic forgetting, and poor generalization. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention for code-related tasks, but their potential in WebShell detection remains underexplored. In this paper, we make two major contributions: (1) a comprehensive evaluation of seven LLMs, including GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 variants, benchmarked against traditional sequence- and graph-based methods using a dataset of 26.59K PHP scripts, and (2) the Behavioral Function-Aware Detection (BFAD) framework, designed to address the specific challenges of applying LLMs to this domain. Our framework integrates three components: a Critical Function Filter that isolates malicious PHP function calls, a Context-Aware Code Extraction strategy that captures the most behaviorally indicative code segments, and Weighted Behavioral Function Profiling (WBFP) that enhances in-context learning by prioritizing the most relevant demonstrations based on discriminative function-level profiles. Our results show that larger LLMs achieve near-perfect precision but lower recall, while smaller models exhibit the opposite trade-off. However, all models lag behind previous State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. With BFAD, the performance of all LLMs improved, with an average F1 score increase of 13.82%. Larger models such as GPT-4, LLaMA 3.1 70B, and Qwen 2.5 14B outperform SOTA methods, while smaller models such as Qwen 2.5 3B achieve performance competitive with traditional methods.

While LLMs have shown promise in general web search scenarios, their effectiveness for evaluating domain-specific search results, such as educational resources, remains unexplored. To investigate different ways of including domain-specific criteria in LLM prompts for relevance judgement, we collected and released a dataset of 401 human relevance judgements from a user study involving teaching professionals performing search tasks related to lesson planning. We compared three approaches to structuring these prompts: a simple two-aspect evaluation baseline from prior work on using LLMs as relevance judges, a comprehensive 12-dimensional rubric derived from educational literature, and criteria directly informed by the study participants. Using domain-specific frameworks, LLMs achieved strong agreement with human judgements (Cohen's κ
 up to 0.650), significantly outperforming the baseline approach. The participant-derived framework proved particularly robust, with GPT-3.5 achieving κ
 scores of 0.639 and 0.613 for 10-dimension and 5-dimension versions respectively. System-level evaluation showed that LLM judgements reliably identified top-performing retrieval approaches (RBO scores 0.71-0.76) while maintaining reasonable discrimination between systems (RBO 0.52-0.56).

At its core, AI-U fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate instructor-aligned responses from lecture videos, notes, and textbooks. Using a graduate-level finite-element-method (FEM) course as a case study, we present a scalable pipeline to systematically construct training data, fine-tune an open-source LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and optimize its responses through RAG-based synthesis. Our evaluation - combining cosine similarity, LLM-based assessment, and expert review - demonstrates strong alignment with course materials. We also have developed a prototype web application, available at https://my-ai-university.com, that enhances traceability by linking AI-generated responses to specific sections of the relevant course material and time-stamped instances of the open-access video lectures. Our expert model is found to have greater cosine similarity with a reference on 86% of test cases. An LLM judge also found our expert model to outperform the base Llama 3.2 model approximately four times out of five. AI-U offers a scalable approach to AI-assisted education, paving the way for broader adoption in higher education. Here, our framework has been presented in the setting of a class on FEM - a subject that is central to training PhD and Master students in engineering science.

As their resource requirements are significantly lower than Large Language Models (LLMs), these can be deployed potentially on more types of devices. SLMs often are benchmarked on health/medicine-related tasks, such as MedQA, although performance on these can vary especially depending on the size of the model in terms of number of parameters. Furthermore, these test results may not necessarily reflect real-world performance regarding the automatic labelling or identification of texts in documents and the web. As a result, we compared topic-relatedness scores from Microsofts phi-3-mini-4k-instruct SLM to the topic-relatedness scores from 7 human evaluators on 1144 samples of medical/health-related texts and 1117 samples of sports injury-related texts. These texts were from a larger dataset of about 9 million news headlines, each of which were processed and assigned scores by phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Our sample was selected (filtered) based on 1 (low filtering) or more (high filtering) Boolean conditions on the phi-3 SLM scores. We found low-moderate significant correlations between the scores from the SLM and human evaluators for sports injury texts with low filtering (\r{ho} = 0.3413, p < 0.001) and medicine/health texts with high filtering (\r{ho} = 0.3854, p < 0.001), and low significant correlation for medicine/health texts with low filtering (\r{ho} = 0.2255, p < 0.001).

While existing benchmarks focus on basic plan validity, they neglect critical aspects such as route efficiency, POI appeal, and real-time adaptability. This paper introduces TP-RAG, the first benchmark tailored for retrieval-augmented, spatiotemporal-aware travel planning. Our dataset includes 2,348 real-world travel queries, 85,575 fine-grain annotated POIs, and 18,784 high-quality travel trajectory references sourced from online tourist documents, enabling dynamic and context-aware planning. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that integrating reference trajectories significantly improves spatial efficiency and POI rationality of the travel plan, while challenges persist in universality and robustness due to conflicting references and noisy data. To address these issues, we propose EvoRAG, an evolutionary framework that potently synergizes diverse retrieved trajectories with LLMs' intrinsic reasoning. EvoRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving spatiotemporal compliance and reducing commonsense violation compared to ground-up and retrieval-augmented baselines.

Pesl,"Modern enterprise computing systems integrate numerous subsystems to resolve a common task by yielding emergent behavior. A widespread approach is using services implemented with Web technologies like REST or OpenAPI, which offer an interaction mechanism and service documentation standard, respectively. Each service represents a specific business functionality, allowing encapsulation and easier maintenance. Despite the reduced maintenance costs on an individual service level, increased integration complexity arises. Consequently, automated service composition approaches have arisen to mitigate this issue. Nevertheless, these approaches have not achieved high acceptance in practice due to their reliance on complex formal modeling. Within this Ph.D. thesis, we analyze the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically integrate the services based on a natural language input. The result is a reusable service composition, e.g., as program code. While not always generating entirely correct results, the result can still be helpful by providing integration engineers with a close approximation of a suitable solution, which requires little effort to become operational. Our research involves (i) introducing a software architecture for automated service composition using LLMs, (ii) analyzing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for service discovery, (iii) proposing a novel natural language query-based benchmark for service discovery, and (iv) extending the benchmark to complete service composition scenarios. We have presented our software architecture as Compositio Prompto, the analysis of RAG for service discovery, and submitted a proposal for the service discovery benchmark. Open topics are primarily the extension of the service discovery benchmark to service composition scenarios and the improvements of the service composition generation, e.g., using fine-tuning or LLM agents.","Submitted 11 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

Traditional Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) struggle to detect highly obfuscated and complex attacks, as their rules require manual updates. This paper presents a novel generative AI framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance XSS mitigation. The framework achieves two primary objectives: (1) generating sophisticated and syntactically validated XSS payloads using in-context learning, and (2) automating defense mechanisms by testing these attacks against a vulnerable application secured by a WAF, classifying bypassing attacks, and generating effective WAF security rules. Experimental results using GPT-4o demonstrate the framework's effectiveness generating 264 XSS payloads, 83% of which were validated, with 80% bypassing ModSecurity WAF equipped with an industry standard security rule set developed by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) to protect against web vulnerabilities.

It iteratively generates web queries, collects information, summarizes findings, and refines subsequent searches through reflection. By shifting away from static references, TALE aligns with free-form question-answering tasks common in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on multiple free-form QA benchmarks show that TALE not only outperforms standard reference-based metrics for measuring response accuracy but also achieves substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluations.

To help address this gap, this paper explores the use of LLMs for generating executable acceptance tests for web applications through a two-step process: (i) generating acceptance test scenarios in natural language (in Gherkin) from user stories, and (ii) converting these scenarios into executable test scripts (in Cypress), knowing the HTML code of the pages under test. This two-step approach supports acceptance test-driven development, enhances tester control, and improves test quality. The two steps were implemented in the AutoUAT and Test Flow tools, respectively, powered by GPT-4 Turbo, and integrated into a partner company's workflow and evaluated on real-world projects. The users found the acceptance test scenarios generated by AutoUAT helpful 95% of the time, even revealing previously overlooked cases. Regarding Test Flow, 92% of the acceptance test cases generated by Test Flow were considered helpful: 60% were usable as generated, 8% required minor fixes, and 24% needed to be regenerated with additional inputs; the remaining 8% were discarded due to major issues.

However, current RAG methods rely on agent-specific strategies for individual data sources, posing challenges low-resource or black-box environments and complicates operations when evidence is fragmented across sources. To address these limitations, we propose ER-RAG, a framework that unifies evidence integration across heterogeneous data sources using the Entity-Relationship (ER) model. ER-RAG standardizes entity retrieval and relationship querying through ER-based APIs with GET and JOIN operations. It employs a two-stage generation process: first, a preference optimization module selects optimal sources; second, another module constructs API chains based on source schemas. This unified approach allows efficient fine-tuning and seamless integration across diverse data sources.

However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the \textit{data compliance gap}
 (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.","Submitted 8 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

From statistical quality flags to LLM-based labeling systems, datasets are divided into categories, frequently reducing to a binary: those passing the filters deemed as valuable examples, others discarded as useless or detrimental. However, a more detailed understanding of the contribution of different kinds of texts to model performance is still largely lacking. In this article, we present the first study utilizing registers (also known as genres) - a widely used standard in corpus linguistics to model linguistic variation - to curate pretraining datasets and investigate the effect of register on the performance of LLMs. We perform comparative studies by training models with register classified data and evaluating them using standard benchmarks, and show that the register of pretraining data substantially affects model performance. We uncover surprising relationships between the pretraining material and the resulting models: using the News register results in subpar performance, and on the contrary, including the Opinion class, covering texts such as reviews and opinion blogs, is highly beneficial. While a model trained on the entire unfiltered dataset outperforms those trained on datasets limited to a single register, combining well-performing registers like How-to-Instructions, Informational Description, and Opinion leads to major improvements. Furthermore, analysis of individual benchmark results reveals key differences in the strengths and drawbacks of specific register classes as pretraining data. These findings show that register is an important explainer of model variation and can facilitate more deliberate future data selection practices.","Submitted 2 April, 2025; originally announced April 2025."

Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a potential alternative by powering Autonomous Web Agents (AWAs) that can autonomously interact with applications. These agents may serve as Autonomous Test Agents (ATAs), potentially reducing the need for maintenance-heavy automated scripts by utilising natural language instructions similar to those used by human testers. This paper investigates the feasibility of adapting AWAs for natural language test case execution and how to evaluate them. We contribute with (1) a benchmark of three offline web applications, and a suite of 113 manual test cases, split between passing and failing cases, to evaluate and compare ATAs performance, (2) SeeAct-ATA and pinATA, two open-source ATA implementations capable of executing test steps, verifying assertions and giving verdicts, and (3) comparative experiments using our benchmark that quantifies our ATAs effectiveness. Finally we also proceed to a qualitative evaluation to identify the limitations of PinATA, our best performing implementation. Our findings reveal that our simple implementation, SeeAct-ATA, does not perform well compared to our more advanced PinATA implementation when executing test cases (50% performance improvement). However, while PinATA obtains around 60% of correct verdict and up to a promising 94% specificity, we identify several limitations that need to be addressed to develop more resilient and reliable ATAs, paving the way for robust, low maintenance test automation.

The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions.

However, they remain highly vulnerable to malicious instructions and attacks, which can result in severe consequences such as privacy breaches and financial losses. More critically, existing guardrails for LLMs are not applicable due to the complex and dynamic nature of agents. To tackle these challenges, we propose ShieldAgent, the first guardrail agent designed to enforce explicit safety policy compliance for the action trajectory of other protected agents through logical reasoning. Specifically, ShieldAgent first constructs a safety policy model by extracting verifiable rules from policy documents and structuring them into a set of action-based probabilistic rule circuits. Given the action trajectory of the protected agent, ShieldAgent retrieves relevant rule circuits and generates a shielding plan, leveraging its comprehensive tool library and executable code for formal verification.

Fast forward to today, and ChatGPT has reignited AI enthusiasm, built on deep learning and advanced neural models.

The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data.

Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training.

However, a critical question remains: Do these mathematical reasoning abilities persist when LLMs are presented with culturally adapted math problems? Specifically, how do LLMs perform when faced with math problems embedded in cultural contexts that have no significant representation in main stream web-scale AI training data? To explore this, we generated six synthetic cultural datasets from GSM8K, a widely used benchmark for assessing LLMs' mathematical reasoning skills. While preserving the mathematical logic and numerical values of the original GSM8K test set, we modify cultural elements such as personal names, food items, place names, etc. These culturally adapted datasets provide a more reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' mathematical reasoning under shifting cultural contexts. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle with math problems when cultural references change, even though the underlying mathematical structure remains constant. Smaller models exhibit greater performance drops compared to larger models. Interestingly, our results also suggest that cultural familiarity can enhance mathematical reasoning. Even models with no explicit mathematical training but exposure to relevant cultural contexts sometimes outperform larger, mathematically proficient models on culturally embedded math problems.

Existing benchmarks for hallucination detection focus primarily on English and a few widely spoken languages, lacking the breadth to assess inconsistencies in model performance across diverse linguistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce Poly-FEVER, a large-scale multilingual fact verification benchmark specifically designed for evaluating hallucination detection in LLMs. Poly-FEVER comprises 77,973 labeled factual claims spanning 11 languages, sourced from FEVER, Climate-FEVER, and SciFact.

Built upon a large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent framework, LogiAgent integrates a Test Scenario Generator, API Request Executor, and API Response Validator to collaboratively generate, execute, and validate API test scenarios. Unlike traditional testing methods that focus on status codes like 5xx, LogiAgent incorporates logical oracles that assess responses based on business logic, ensuring more comprehensive testing. The system is further enhanced by an Execution Memory component that stores historical API execution data for contextual consistency. We conduct extensive experiments across 12 real-world REST systems, demonstrating that LogiAgent effectively identifies 234 logical issues with an accuracy of 66.19%. Additionally, it basically excels in detecting server crashes and achieves superior test coverage compared to four state-of-the-art REST API testing tools.

Consequently, numerous data selection methods have been proposed to identify subsets of data that can effectively and efficiently enhance model performance. However, most of these methods focus on general data selection and tend to overlook the specific nuances of domain-related data. In this paper, we introduce MASS, a \textbf{MA}thematical data \textbf{S}election framework using the \textbf{S}kill graph for pretraining LLMs in the mathematical reasoning domain. By taking into account the unique characteristics of mathematics and reasoning, we construct a skill graph that captures the mathematical skills and their interrelations from a reference dataset. This skill graph guides us in assigning quality scores to the target dataset, enabling us to select the top-ranked subset which is further used to pretrain LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of MASS across different model sizes (1B and 7B) and pretraining datasets (web data and synthetic data). Specifically, in terms of efficiency, models trained on subsets selected by MASS can achieve similar performance to models trained on the original datasets, with a significant reduction in the number of trained tokens - ranging from 50\% to 70\% fewer tokens. In terms of effectiveness, when trained on the same amount of tokens, models trained on the data selected by MASS outperform those trained on the original datasets by 3.3\% to 5.9\%.

Modern techniques typically rely on large models for representing general knowledge of one or several languages (Large Language Models, LLMs), or for representing speech and general audio characteristics. These models have been trained with large amounts of speech and language data, typically including web content. When humans interact with such technologies, the effectiveness of the interaction will be influenced by how far humans make use of the same type of language the models have been trained on or, in other words, if the models are able to generalize to the language used by humans when interacting with the technology. This may lead to some gradual forms of adaptation in human speech and language production, and users who do not adapt may be excluded from efficient use of such technologies. On top of this, as commercial model development follows market needs, under-represented languages and dialects/sociolects may decrease in terms of priorities. Furthermore, for many lesser spoken languages the necessary data is not available, which will worsen a digital divide in speech and language technology usage.

Despite the widespread adoption of LLMs across domains, there is still no clear consensus on how to define and operationalise trustworthiness. This study aims to bridge the gap between theoretical discussion and practical implementation by analysing research trends, definitions of trustworthiness, and practical techniques. We conducted a bibliometric mapping analysis of 2,006 publications from Web of Science (2019-2025) using the Bibliometrix, and manually reviewed 68 papers. We found a shift from traditional AI ethics discussion to LLM trustworthiness frameworks. We identified 18 different definitions of trust/trustworthiness, with transparency, explainability and reliability emerging as the most common dimensions. We identified 20 strategies to enhance LLM trustworthiness, with fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) being the most prominent. Most of the strategies are developer-driven and applied during the post-training phase. Several authors propose fragmented terminologies rather than unified frameworks, leading to the risks of ""ethics washing,"" where ethical discourse is adopted without a genuine regulatory commitment. Our findings highlight: persistent gaps between theoretical taxonomies and practical implementation, the crucial role of the developer in operationalising trust, and call for standardised frameworks and stronger regulatory measures to enable trustworthy and ethical deployment of LLMs.","Submitted 4 May, 2025; v1 submitted 27 February, 2025; originally announced March 2025."

To interface with an environment, these agents often rely on tools, such as web search or database APIs. As the agent provides the LLM with tool documentation along the user query, the completeness and correctness of this documentation is critical. However, tool documentation is often over-, under-, or ill-specified, impeding the agent's accuracy. Standard software testing approaches struggle to identify these errors as they are expressed in natural language. Thus, despite its importance, there currently exists no automated method to test the tool documentation for agents. To address this issue, we present ToolFuzz, the first method for automated testing of tool documentations. ToolFuzz is designed to discover two types of errors: (1) user queries leading to tool runtime errors and (2) user queries that lead to incorrect agent responses. ToolFuzz can generate a large and diverse set of natural inputs, effectively finding tool description errors at a low false positive rate. Further, we present two straightforward prompt-engineering approaches. We evaluate all three tool testing approaches on 32 common LangChain tools and 35 newly created custom tools and 2 novel benchmarks to further strengthen the assessment. We find that many publicly available tools suffer from underspecification. Specifically, we show that ToolFuzz identifies 20x more erroneous inputs compared to the prompt-engineering approaches, making it a key component for building reliable AI agents.","Submitted 11 March, 2025; v1 submitted 6 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025."

We show that the temporality of search engine translates into tool-dependent agent performance but can be alleviated with base model choice and explicit reasoning instructions such as chain-of-thought prompting.

However, these advancements amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, especially when agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Nevertheless, manipulating LLM agents into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains challenging, as these agents extensively reason or plan before executing final actions. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM agents that dynamically hijacks the agent's reasoning processes to compel malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first generates the model's reasoning trace for the given task, then automatically identifies optimal points within this trace to insert targeted perturbations. The resulting perturbed reasoning is then used as a surrogate response for optimization. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools.

The backdoored evaluator victimizes benign users by unfairly assigning inflated scores to adversary. A trivial single token backdoor poisoning 1% of the evaluator training data triples the adversary's score with respect to their legitimate score. We systematically categorize levels of data access corresponding to three real-world settings, (1) web poisoning, (2) malicious annotator, and (3) weight poisoning. These regimes reflect a weak to strong escalation of data access that highly correlates with attack severity. Under the weakest assumptions - web poisoning (1), the adversary still induces a 20% score inflation. Likewise, in the (3) weight poisoning regime, the stronger assumptions enable the adversary to inflate their scores from 1.5/5 to 4.9/5. The backdoor threat generalizes across different evaluator architectures, trigger designs, evaluation tasks, and poisoning rates. By poisoning 10% of the evaluator training data, we control toxicity judges (Guardrails) to misclassify toxic prompts as non-toxic 89% of the time, and document reranker judges in RAG to rank the poisoned document first 97% of the time. LLM-as-a-Judge is uniquely positioned at the intersection of ethics and technology, where social implications of mislead model selection and evaluation constrain the available defensive tools. Amidst these challenges, model merging emerges as a principled tool to offset the backdoor, reducing ASR to near 0% whilst maintaining SOTA performance. Model merging's low computational cost and convenient integration into the current LLM Judge training pipeline position it as a promising avenue for backdoor mitigation in the LLM-as-a-Judge setting.","Submitted 1 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025."

The application of generative models for content-aware layout generation has recently gained traction. However, these models fail to understand the contextual aesthetic requirements of layout design and do not align with human-like preferences, primarily treating it as a prediction task without considering the final rendered output. To overcome these problems, we offer Aesthetic-Aware Preference Alignment(AAPA), a novel technique to train a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) for layout prediction that uses MLLM's aesthetic preferences for Direct Preference Optimization over graphic layouts. We propose a data filtering protocol utilizing our layout-quality heuristics for AAPA to ensure training happens on high-quality layouts. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation metric that uses another MLLM to compute the win rate of the generated layout against the ground-truth layout based on aesthetics criteria. We also demonstrate the applicability of AAPA for MLLMs of varying scales (1B to 8B parameters) and LLM families (Qwen, Phi, InternLM). By conducting thorough qualitative and quantitative analyses, we verify the efficacy of our approach on two challenging benchmarks - Crello and Webui, showcasing 17%, and 16 improvement over current State-of-The-Art methods, thereby highlighting the potential of MLLMs in aesthetic-aware layout generation.","Submitted 1 March, 2025; originally announced March 2025."

Exploring Semantic Size in Human-like Cognition,"Yao Yao, Yifei Yang, Xinbei Ma, Dongjie Yang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao","How human cognitive abilities are formed has long captivated researchers. However, a significant challenge lies in developing meaningful methods to measure these complex processes. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), which now rival human capabilities in various domains, we are presented with a unique testbed to investigate human cognition through a new lens. Among the many facets of cognition, one particularly crucial aspect is the concept of semantic size, the perceived magnitude of both abstract and concrete words or concepts. This study seeks to investigate whether LLMs exhibit similar tendencies in understanding semantic size, thereby providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of human cognition. We begin by exploring metaphorical reasoning, comparing how LLMs and humans associate abstract words with concrete objects of varying sizes. Next, we examine LLMs' internal representations to evaluate their alignment with human cognitive processes. Our findings reveal that multi-modal training is crucial for LLMs to achieve more human-like understanding, suggesting that real-world, multi-modal experiences are similarly vital for human cognitive development. Lastly, we examine whether LLMs are influenced by attention-grabbing headlines with larger semantic sizes in a real-world web shopping scenario. The results show that multi-modal LLMs are more emotionally engaged in decision-making, but this also introduces potential biases, such as the risk of manipulation through clickbait headlines. Ultimately, this study offers a novel perspective on how LLMs interpret and internalize language, from the smallest concrete objects to the most profound abstract concepts like love.

Existing RAG methods typically employ query rewriting to clarify the user intent and manage multi-hop logic, while using hybrid retrieval to expand search scope. However, the tight coupling of query rewriting to the dense retriever limits its compatibility with hybrid retrieval, impeding further RAG performance improvements. To address this challenge, we introduce a high-level searcher that decomposes complex queries into atomic queries, independent of any retriever-specific optimizations. Additionally, to harness the strengths of sparse retrievers for precise keyword retrieval, we have developed a new sparse searcher that employs Lucene syntax to enhance retrieval accuracy.Alongside web and dense searchers, these components seamlessly collaborate within our proposed method, \textbf{LevelRAG}. In LevelRAG, the high-level searcher orchestrates the retrieval logic, while the low-level searchers (sparse, web, and dense) refine the queries for optimal retrieval. This approach enhances both the completeness and accuracy of the retrieval process, overcoming challenges associated with current query rewriting techniques in hybrid retrieval scenarios.

By leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) assisted classification and information extraction on texts from over five million company websites, WAI quantifies the degree and nature of firms' responses to external shocks. Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a specific application, we show that WAI is highly correlated with pandemic containment measures and reliably predicts firm performance. Unlike traditional data sources, WAI provides timely firm-level information across industries and geographies worldwide that would otherwise be unavailable due to institutional and data availability constraints. This methodology offers significant potential for monitoring and mitigating the impact of technological, political, financial, health or environmental crises, and represents a transformative tool for adaptive policy-making and economic resilience.","Submitted 24 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."

Compared to traditional search engines, LLM-powered AI search agents are capable of understanding and responding to complex queries with greater depth, enabling more accurate operations and better context recognition. However, little attention and effort has been paid to the Chinese web search, which results in that the capabilities of open-source models have not been uniformly and fairly evaluated. The difficulty lies in lacking three aspects: an unified agent framework, an accurately labeled dataset, and a suitable evaluation metric. To address these issues, we propose a general-purpose and training-free web search agent by level-aware navigation, Level-Navi Agent, accompanied by a well-annotated dataset (Web24) and a suitable evaluation metric. Level-Navi Agent can think through complex user questions and conduct searches across various levels on the internet to gather information for questions.

Since online data is the primary resource for LLM pre-training, subsequent models could be trained on an unknown portion of synthetic samples. This will lead to model collapse, a degenerative process whereby LLMs reinforce their own errors, converge to a low variance output distribution, and ultimately yield a declining performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of decoding strategy on model collapse, analysing the text characteristics at each model generation, the similarity to human references, and the resulting model performance. Using the decoding strategies that lead to the most significant degradation, we evaluate model collapse in more realistic scenarios where the origin of the data (human or synthetic) is unknown. We train a machine-generated text detector and propose an importance sampling approach to alleviate model collapse. Our method is validated on two LLM variants (GPT-2 and SmolLM2), across a range of model sizes (124M to 1.7B), on the open-ended text generation task. We demonstrate that it can not only prevent model collapse but also improve performance when sufficient human-authored samples are present.

The traditional approach for automated FV includes a three-part pipeline relying on short evidence snippets and encoder-only inference models. More recent approaches leverage the multi-turn nature of LLMs to address FV as a step-by-step problem where questions inquiring additional context are generated and answered until there is enough information to make a decision. This iterative method makes the verification process rational and explainable. While these methods have been tested for encyclopedic claims, exploration on domain-specific and realistic claims is missing. In this work, we apply an iterative FV system on three medical fact-checking datasets and evaluate it with multiple settings, including different LLMs, external web search, and structured reasoning using logic predicates. We demonstrate improvements in the final performance over traditional approaches and the high potential of step-by-step FV systems for domain-specific claims.","Submitted 20 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."

Current multi-agent systems universally excel in performance, compared to single agents, but struggle with generalization across environments due to predefined roles and inadequate strategies for generalizing language agents. The challenge of achieving both strong performance and good generalization has hindered the progress of multi-agent systems for interactive environments. To address these issues, we propose CollabUIAgents, a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with a novel multi-agent credit re-assignment (CR) strategy, assigning process rewards with LLMs rather than environment-specific rewards and learning with synthesized preference data, in order to foster generalizable, collaborative behaviors among the role-free agents' policies. Empirical results show that our framework improves both performance and cross-environment generalizability of multi-agent systems. Moreover, our 7B-parameter system achieves results on par with or exceed strong closed-source models, and the LLM that guides the CR.

We tested 13 commonly used ecommerce components (e.g., search, product reviews) and used them as prompts to generate a total of 312 components across all models. Over one-third of generated components contain at least one dark pattern. The majority of dark pattern strategies involve hiding crucial information, limiting users' actions, and manipulating them into making decisions through a sense of urgency. Dark patterns are also more frequently produced in components that are related to company interests.

We investigate the effect of retrieval augmented generation and search-grounding techniques on LLMs' ability to display familiarity with various national cultures. Specifically, we compare the performance of standard LLMs, LLMs augmented with retrievals from a bespoke knowledge base (i.e., KB grounding), and LLMs augmented with retrievals from a web search (i.e., search grounding) on multiple cultural awareness benchmarks. We find that search grounding significantly improves the LLM performance on multiple-choice benchmarks that test propositional knowledge (e.g., cultural norms, artifacts, and institutions), while KB grounding's effectiveness is limited by inadequate knowledge base coverage and a suboptimal retriever. However, search grounding also increases the risk of stereotypical judgments by language models and fails to improve evaluators' judgments of cultural familiarity in a human evaluation with adequate statistical power. These results highlight the distinction between propositional cultural knowledge and open-ended cultural fluency when it comes to evaluating LLMs' cultural awareness.","Submitted 16 June, 2025; v1 submitted 19 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."

The same can not be said for most other languages as LLMs still underperform for non-English languages, likely due to a gap in the quality and diversity of the available multilingual pretraining corpora. In this work, we find that machine-translated texts from a single high-quality source language can contribute significantly to the pretraining quality of multilingual LLMs. We translate FineWeb-Edu, a high-quality English web dataset, into nine languages, resulting in a 1.7-trillion-token dataset, which we call TransWebEdu and pretrain a 1.3B-parameter model, TransWebLLM, from scratch on this dataset.

Differentiating between a text written by a human and one generated by an LLM has become almost impossible. Information-hiding techniques such as digital watermarking or steganography can help by embedding information inside text in a form that is unlikely to be noticed. However, existing techniques, such as linguistic-based or format-based methods, change the semantics or cannot be applied to pure, unformatted text. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for information hiding called Innamark, which can conceal any byte-encoded sequence within a sufficiently long cover text. This method is implemented as a multi-platform library using the Kotlin programming language, which is accompanied by a command-line tool and a web interface. By substituting conventional whitespace characters with visually similar Unicode whitespace characters, our proposed scheme preserves the semantics of the cover text without changing the number of characters. Furthermore, we propose a specified structure for secret messages that enables configurable compression, encryption, hashing, and error correction. An experimental benchmark comparison on a dataset of 1000000 Wikipedia articles compares ten algorithms. The results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed Innamark method in various applications and the imperceptibility of its watermarks to humans. We discuss the limits to the embedding capacity and robustness of the algorithm and how these could be addressed in future work.","Submitted 28 April, 2025; v1 submitted 18 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."

Existing methods for strategic reasoning face challenges in adaptability, scalability, and transferring strategies to new contexts. To address these issues, we propose explicit policy optimization (EPO) for strategic reasoning, featuring an LLM that provides strategies in open-ended action space and can be plugged into arbitrary LLM agents to motivate goal-directed behavior.

Manual extraction by experts is time-consuming and expensive, limiting scalability. Large language models (LLMs) offer efficient automated extraction through zero-shot prompting, requiring only natural language instructions without labeled data or training. We evaluate LLMs' accuracy in extracting structured information from breast cancer histopathology reports, compared to manual extraction by a trained human annotator. Methods: We developed the Medical Report Information Extractor, a web application leveraging LLMs for automated extraction. We developed a gold standard extraction dataset to evaluate the human annotator alongside five LLMs including GPT-4o, a leading proprietary model, and the Llama 3 model family, which allows self-hosting for data privacy. Our assessment involved 111 histopathology reports from the Breast Cancer Now (BCN) Generations Study, extracting 51 pathology features specified in the study's data dictionary. Results: Evaluation against the gold standard dataset showed that both Llama 3.1 405B (94.7% accuracy) and GPT-4o (96.1%) achieved extraction accuracy comparable to the human annotator (95.4%; p = 0.146 and p = 0.106, respectively). While Llama 3.1 70B (91.6%) performed below human accuracy (p <0.001), its reduced computational requirements make it a viable option for self-hosting.

Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits, and solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs should be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application modules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we introduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for the generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical reasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of most modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right, requiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality, and (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted third-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an imperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications with comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by executing end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of current LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model, OpenAI o1, achieves a mere 62% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could successfully execute security exploits on around half of the correct programs generated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models further struggle to generate correct and secure applications.

The frontend user interface, a Progressive Web App (PWA), displays information and biomarker score graphs on a smartphone in real-time to human users (PLwD, caregivers, clinicians). Six speech biomarkers based on the existing literature - Altered Grammar, Pragmatic Impairments, Anomia, Disrupted Turn-Taking, Slurred Pronunciation, and Prosody Changes - were developed for the robot conversation system using two datasets, one that included conversations of PLwD with a human clinician (DementiaBank dataset) and one that included conversations of PLwD with a robot (Indiana dataset).

We utilize GPT-4V to generate image-contextual captions and OpenChat 3.5 model to convert these captions into diverse free-form and multiple-choice question-answer pairs. Integrating this dataset for fine-tuning considerably enhances VLM performance across multiple benchmarks. Unlike methods that focus solely on fine-grained visual content, our approach leverages accompanying web context, yielding superior results. We also discover that a 'leaky modality mix', where conversation samples contain questions answerable from both the image and its contextual caption, outperforms non-leaky combinations of captions and Q&A pairs.

This paper presents ScamFerret, an innovative agent system employing a large language model (LLM) to autonomously collect and analyze data from a given URL to determine whether it is a scam. Unlike traditional machine learning models that require large datasets and feature engineering, ScamFerret leverages LLMs' natural language understanding to accurately identify scam websites of various types and languages without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Our evaluation demonstrated that ScamFerret achieves 0.972 accuracy in classifying four scam types in English and 0.993 accuracy in classifying online shopping websites across three different languages, particularly when using GPT-4. Furthermore, we confirmed that ScamFerret collects and analyzes external information such as web content, DNS records, and user reviews as necessary, providing a basis for identifying scam websites from multiple perspectives. These results suggest that LLMs have significant potential in enhancing cybersecurity measures against sophisticated scam websites.","Submitted 14 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."

earch: Unlocking the Reasoning Potential of Large Models for Web-based Source Search","Zhengqiu Zhu, Yatai Ji, Jiaheng Huang, Yong Zhao, Sihang Qiu, Rusheng Ju","Web-based management systems have been widely used in risk control and industrial safety. However, effectively integrating source search capabilities into these systems, to enable decision-makers to locate and address the hazard (e.g., gas leak detection) remains a challenge. While prior efforts have explored using web crowdsourcing and AI algorithms for source search decision support, these approaches suffer from overheads in recruiting human participants and slow response times in time-sensitive situations. To address this, we introduce AutoS^2

This study establishes baseline comparisons for Automated Fact-Checking (AFC) using Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple labeling schemes (binary, three-class, five-class) and extends traditional claim verification by incorporating analysis, verdict classification, and explanation in a structured setup to provide comprehensive justifications for real-world claims.

While Generative AI offers automation potential for code generation, it struggles with complex scientific applications due to challenges in integrating domain knowledge, software engineering principles, and UI design best practices. This paper introduces a knowledge-augmented code generation framework that retrieves software engineering best practices, domain expertise, and advanced technology stacks from a specialized knowledge base to enhance Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) for front-end development. The framework automates the creation of GIS-based web applications (e.g., dashboards, interfaces) from user-defined UI wireframes sketched in tools like PowerPoint or Adobe Illustrator. A novel Context-Aware Visual Prompting method, implemented in Python, extracts layouts and interface features from these wireframes to guide code generation. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate front-end code by integrating structured reasoning, software engineering principles, and domain knowledge, drawing inspiration from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). A case study demonstrates the framework's capability to generate a modular, maintainable web platform hosting multiple dashboards for visualizing environmental and energy data (e.g., time-series, shapefiles, rasters) from user-sketched wireframes. By employing a knowledge-driven approach, the framework produces scalable, industry-standard front-end code using design patterns such as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and frameworks like React. This significantly reduces manual effort in design and coding, pioneering an automated and efficient method for developing smart city software.","Submitted 12 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."

These attacks may extract private information or coerce the model into producing harmful outputs. In real-world deployments, LLMs are often part of a larger agentic pipeline including memory systems, retrieval, web access, and API calling. Such additional components introduce vulnerabilities that make these LLM-powered agents much easier to attack than isolated LLMs, yet relatively little work focuses on the security of LLM agents. In this paper, we analyze security and privacy vulnerabilities that are unique to LLM agents. We first provide a taxonomy of attacks categorized by threat actors, objectives, entry points, attacker observability, attack strategies, and inherent vulnerabilities of agent pipelines.

Publishing incentives encourage researchers to present ""positive"" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal. Consequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results, especially in article abstracts. Such spin can influence clinician interpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions. In this study, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin. This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.","Submitted 5 May, 2025; v1 submitted 11 February, 2025; originally announced February 2025."

Agudelo, Peter Qian, Tianlong Chen","Web browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential in automating complex web-based tasks. Existing approaches typically rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to explore web environments and generate trajectory data, which is then used either for demonstration retrieval (for large LLMs) or to distill small LLMs (e.g., Llama3) in a process that remains decoupled from the exploration. In this paper, we propose AgentSymbiotic, an iterative framework that couples data synthesis with task-performance, yielding a ""symbiotic improvement"" for both large and small LLMs. Our study uncovers a complementary dynamic between LLM types: while large LLMs excel at generating high-quality trajectories for distillation, the distilled small LLMs-owing to their distinct reasoning capabilities-often choose actions that diverge from those of their larger counterparts. This divergence drives the exploration of novel trajectories, thereby enriching the synthesized data. However, we also observe that the performance of small LLMs becomes a bottleneck in this iterative enhancement process. To address this, we propose two innovations in LLM distillation: a speculative data synthesis strategy that mitigates off-policy bias, and a multi-task learning approach designed to boost the reasoning capabilities of the student LLM. Furthermore, we introduce a Hybrid Mode for Privacy Preservation to address user privacy concerns. Evaluated on the WEBARENA benchmark, AgentSymbiotic achieves SOTA performance with both LLM types. Our best Large LLM agent reaches 52%, surpassing the previous best of 45%, while our 8B distilled model demonstrates a competitive 49%, exceeding the prior best of 28%.

This research studies the potential for large language models (LLMs) to analyze and detect insider threat sentiment within job site reviews. Addressing ethical data collection concerns, this research utilizes synthetic data generation using LLMs alongside existing job review datasets. A comparative analysis of sentiment scores generated by LLMs is benchmarked against expert human scoring. Findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate alignment with human evaluations in most cases, thus effectively identifying nuanced indicators of threat sentiment. The performance is lower on human-generated data than synthetic data, suggesting areas for improvement in evaluating real-world data. Text diversity analysis found differences between human-generated and LLM-generated datasets, with synthetic data exhibiting somewhat lower diversity.

In contrast to previous works that focus on low quality or synthetic data, our study \textbf{provides the first systematic investigation of such random noise through a cohesive ``What-Why-How'' framework.} Surprisingly, we observed that the resulting increase in the loss of next-token prediction (NTP) was significantly lower than the proportion of random noise even when the model was scaled up to 2.7B. We provide a theoretical justification for this phenomenon, which also elucidates the success of multilingual models and can be applied to multimodal models. On the other hand, experiments show that the model's performance in downstream tasks is not based solely on the NTP loss, which means that random noise may result in degraded downstream performance. To address the potential adverse effects, we introduce a novel plug-and-play Local Gradient Matching loss, which explicitly enhances the denoising capability of the downstream task head by aligning the gradient of normal and perturbed features without requiring knowledge of the model's parameters.

In this study, we conduct the first safety risk quantification on seven production AIPSEs by systematically defining the threat model, risk type, and evaluating responses to various query types. With data collected from PhishTank, ThreatBook, and LevelBlue, our findings reveal that AIPSEs frequently generate harmful content that contains malicious URLs even with benign queries (e.g., with benign keywords). We also observe that directly querying a URL will increase the number of main risk-inclusive responses, while querying with natural language will slightly mitigate such risk. Compared to traditional search engines, AIPSEs outperform in both utility and safety. We further perform two case studies on online document spoofing and phishing to show the ease of deceiving AIPSEs in the real-world setting. To mitigate these risks, we develop an agent-based defense with a GPT-4.1-based content refinement tool and a URL detector.

Effectively visualizing these uncertainties can enhance the usability of LLM outputs, particularly in contexts where translation accuracy is critical. This paper addresses two primary objectives: (1) providing users with token-level insights into model confidence and (2) developing a web-based visualization tool to quantify and represent translation uncertainties. To achieve these goals, we utilized the T5 model with the WMT19 dataset for translation tasks and evaluated translation quality using established metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE. We introduced three novel uncertainty quantification (UQ) metrics: (1) the geometric mean of token probabilities, (2) the arithmetic mean of token probabilities, and (3) the arithmetic mean of the kurtosis of token distributions. These metrics provide a simple yet effective framework for evaluating translation performance. Our analysis revealed a linear relationship between the traditional evaluation metrics and our UQ metrics, demonstrating the validity of our approach. Additionally, we developed an interactive web-based visualization that uses a color gradient to represent token confidence. This tool offers users a clear and intuitive understanding of translation quality while providing valuable insights into model performance. Overall, we show that our UQ metrics and visualization are both robust and interpretable, offering practical tools for evaluating and accessing machine translation systems.","Submitted 24 February, 2025; v1 submitted 26 January, 2025; originally announced January 2025."

However, ensuring their safety is paramount as they might provide harmful and unsafe responses. Existing LLM testing frameworks address various safety-related concerns (e.g., drugs, terrorism, animal abuse) but often face challenges due to unbalanced and obsolete datasets. In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs. First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage criterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse set of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e., different style and persuasive writing techniques). Second, we propose an LLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test inputs. Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage LLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs, allowing a fully automated testing approach. We conduct an extensive evaluation on well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms other LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe responses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs that are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard); ii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many unsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently used static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with web browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test inputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors.","Submitted 28 January, 2025; originally announced January 2025."

The abilities of existing LLMs at such tasks are often hindered by the lack of high-quality agent data from the corresponding environments they interact with. We propose Learn-by-interact, a data-centric framework to adapt LLM agents to any given environments without human annotations. Learn-by-interact synthesizes trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories, a process called backward construction. We assess the quality of our synthetic data by using them in both training-based scenarios and training-free in-context learning (ICL), where we craft innovative retrieval approaches optimized for agents. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench, WebArena, OSWorld and Spider2-V spanning across realistic coding, web, and desktop environments show the effectiveness of Learn-by-interact in various downstream agentic tasks -- baseline results are improved by up to 12.2\% for ICL with Claude-3.5 and 19.5\% for training with Codestral-22B. We further demonstrate the critical role of backward construction, which provides up to 14.0\% improvement for training. Our ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency provided by our synthesized data in ICL and the superiority of our retrieval pipeline over alternative approaches like conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art models struggle in certain cases, sometimes failing at problems solvable by young children, indicating that traditional notions of task complexity are insufficient for explaining LLM capabilities. However, exploring LLM capabilities is complicated by the fact that most widely-used models are also ""instruction-tuned"" to respond appropriately to prompts. With the goal of disentangling the factors influencing LLM performance, we investigate whether instruction-tuned models possess fundamentally different capabilities from base models that are prompted using in-context examples. Through extensive experiments across various model families, scales and task types, which included instruction tuning 90 different LLMs, we demonstrate that the performance of instruction-tuned models is significantly correlated with the in-context performance of their base counterparts. By clarifying what instruction-tuning contributes, we extend prior research into in-context learning, which suggests that base models use priors from pretraining data to solve tasks. Specifically, we extend this understanding to instruction-tuned models, suggesting that their pretraining data similarly sets a limiting boundary on the tasks they can solve, with the added influence of the instruction-tuning dataset.","Submitted 15 January, 2025; originally announced January 2025."

Because of the vast search space of operations, parameters, and parameter values, along with their dependencies and constraints, current testing tools often achieve low code coverage, resulting in suboptimal fault detection. To address this limitation, we present AutoRestTest, a novel tool that integrates the Semantic Property Dependency Graph (SPDG) with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and large language models (LLMs) for effective REST API testing. AutoRestTest determines operation-dependent parameters using the SPDG and employs five specialized agents (operation, parameter, value, dependency, and header) to identify dependencies of operations and generate operation sequences, parameter combinations, and values. Through an intuitive command-line interface, users can easily configure and monitor tests with successful operation count, unique server errors detected, and time elapsed.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising test-generation abilities, their application to REST API testing remains mostly unexplored. We present LlamaRestTest, a novel approach that employs two custom LLMs-created by fine-tuning and quantizing the Llama3-8B model using mined datasets of REST API example values and inter-parameter dependencies-to generate realistic test inputs and uncover inter-parameter dependencies during the testing process by analyzing server responses.

However, this mechanism of latent distribution modeling lacks quantitative understanding and analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that any language dataset can be represented by a Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as ``Data-Tree''), where each node denotes a token, each edge denotes a token transition probability, and each sequence has a unique path. Any GPT-like language model can also be flattened into another Monte Carlo Language Tree (abbreviated as ``GPT-Tree''). Our experiments show that different GPT models trained on the same dataset exhibit significant structural similarity in GPT-Tree visualization, and larger models converge more closely to the Data-Tree. More than 87\% GPT output tokens can be recalled by Data-Tree. These findings may confirm that the reasoning process of LLMs is more likely to be probabilistic pattern-matching rather than formal reasoning, as each model inference seems to find a context pattern with maximum probability from the Data-Tree.

This study evaluates ChatGPT's (GPT-4o) ability to generate and improve web pages in line with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). While ChatGPT can effectively address accessibility issues when prompted, its default code often lacks compliance, reflecting limitations in its training data and prevailing inaccessible web practices. Automated and manual testing revealed strengths in resolving simple issues but challenges with complex tasks, requiring human oversight and additional iterations. Unlike prior studies, we incorporate manual evaluation, dynamic elements, and use the visual reasoning capability of ChatGPT along with the prompts to fix accessibility issues. Providing screenshots alongside prompts enhances the LLM's ability to address accessibility issues by allowing it to analyze surrounding components, such as determining appropriate contrast colors. We found that effective prompt engineering, such as providing concise, structured feedback and incorporating visual aids, significantly enhances ChatGPT's performance. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of large language models for accessible web development, offering practical guidance for developers to create more inclusive websites.","Submitted 7 January, 2025; originally announced January 2025."

The complexity arises in aggregating related documents to build a meaningful event graph around a central topic. This paper proposes CHRONOS - Causal Headline Retrieval for Open-domain News Timeline SummarizatiOn via Iterative Self-Questioning, which offers a fresh perspective on the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the task of Timeline Summarization (TLS). By iteratively reflecting on how events are linked and posing new questions regarding a specific news topic to gather information online or from an offline knowledge base, LLMs produce and refresh chronological summaries based on documents retrieved in each round. Furthermore, we curate Open-TLS, a novel dataset of timelines on recent news topics authored by professional journalists to evaluate open-domain TLS where information overload makes it impossible to find comprehensive relevant documents from the web.

However, current protections against web crawling or sample-specific memorization are inherently limited, as they require compliance from crawlers (e.g., respecting robots.txt) or model trainers (e.g., applying differential privacy). To empower data owners with direct control, we propose ExpShiled, a proactive self-defense mechanism that mitigates sample-specific memorization via imperceptible text perturbations. This approach requires no external collaboration while maintaining original readability. To evaluate individual-level defense efficacy, we first propose the metric of instance exploitation: a zero value indicates perfect defense, achieved when a protected text's log-perplexity ranking aligns with its counterfactual untrained ranking. We then reveal and validate the memorization trigger hypothesis, demonstrating that a model's memorization of a specific text sample stems primarily from its outlier tokens. Leveraging this insight, we design targeted perturbations that (1) prioritize inherent trigger tokens and (2) introduce artificial trigger tokens as pitfalls to disrupt memorization on the protected sample. Experiments validate our defense across model scales, languages, vision-to-language tasks, and fine-tuning methods. Even with privacy backdoors, the Membership Inference Attack (MIA) AUC drops from 0.95 to 0.55, and instance exploitation approaches zero. This suggests that compared to the ideal no-misuse scenario, the risk of exposing a text instance remains nearly unchanged despite its inclusion in training data.","Submitted 6 May, 2025; v1 submitted 30 December, 2024; originally announced December 2024."

The application of LLMs to robotics may offer a path to highly capable robots that perform well across most human tasks with limited or even zero tuning. Aside from increasingly sophisticated reasoning and task planning, networks of (suitably designed) LLMs offer ease of upgrading capabilities and allow humans to directly observe the robot's thinking. Here we explore the advantages, limitations, and particularities of using LLMs to control physical robots. The basic system consists of four LLMs communicating via a human language data bus implemented via web sockets and ROS2 message passing. Surprisingly, rich robot behaviors and good performance across different tasks could be achieved despite the robot's data fusion cycle running at only 1Hz and the central data bus running at the extremely limited rates of the human brain, of around 40 bits/s. The use of natural language for inter-LLM communication allowed the robot's reasoning and decision making to be directly observed by humans and made it trivial to bias the system's behavior with sets of rules written in plain English. These rules were immutably written into Ethereum, a global, public, and censorship resistant Turing-complete computer. We suggest that by using natural language as the data bus among interacting AIs, and immutable public ledgers to store behavior constraints, it is possible to build robots that combine unexpectedly rich performance, upgradability, and durable alignment with humans.","Submitted 24 December, 2024; originally announced December 2024."

This paper profiles several RAG execution pipelines and demystifies the complex interplay between their retrieval and generation phases. We demonstrate that while exact retrieval schemes are expensive, they can reduce inference time compared to approximate retrieval variants because an exact retrieval model can send a smaller but more accurate list of documents to the generative model while maintaining the same end-to-end accuracy. This observation motivates the acceleration of the exact nearest neighbor search for RAG.

However, traditional KG-based recommendation methods face fundamental challenges: insufficient consideration of temporal information and poor performance in cold-start scenarios. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be considered databases with a wealth of knowledge learned from the web data, and they have recently gained attention due to their potential application as recommendation systems. Although approaches that treat LLMs as recommendation systems can leverage LLMs' high recommendation literacy, their input token limitations make it impractical to consider the entire recommendation domain dataset and result in scalability issues. To address these challenges, we propose a LLM's Intuition-aware Knowledge graph Reasoning model (LIKR). Our main idea is to treat LLMs as reasoners that output intuitive exploration strategies for KGs. To integrate the knowledge of LLMs and KGs, we trained a recommendation agent through reinforcement learning using a reward function that integrates different recommendation strategies, including LLM's intuition and KG embeddings. By incorporating temporal awareness through prompt engineering and generating textual representations of user preferences from limited interactions, LIKR can improve recommendation performance in cold-start scenarios. Furthermore, LIKR can avoid scalability issues by using KGs to represent recommendation domain datasets and limiting the LLM's output to KG exploration strategies.

Many of these tables are derived from web sources or real-world scenarios, which require meticulous data preparation (or data prep) to ensure accurate responses. However, preparing such tables for NL questions introduces new requirements that extend beyond traditional data preparation. This question-aware data preparation involves specific tasks such as column derivation and filtering tailored to particular questions, as well as question-aware value normalization or conversion, highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach in this context. Because each of the above tasks is unique, a single model (or agent) may not perform effectively across all scenarios. In this paper, we propose AutoPrep, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that leverages the strengths of multiple agents, each specialized in a certain type of data prep, ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Given an NL question over a table, AutoPrep performs data prep through three key components. Planner: Determines a logical plan, outlining a sequence of high-level operations. Programmer: Translates this logical plan into a physical plan by generating the corresponding low-level code. Executor: Executes the generated code to process the table. To support this multi-agent framework, we design a novel Chain-of-Clauses reasoning mechanism for high-level operation suggestion, and a tool-augmented method for low-level code generation...","Submitted 1 May, 2025; v1 submitted 10 December, 2024; originally announced December 2024."

While text-based agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) often require frequent updates due to platform-specific APIs, visual agents leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer enhanced adaptability by interacting directly with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). However, these agents face significant challenges in visual perception, particularly when handling high-resolution, visually complex digital environments. This paper introduces Iris, a foundational visual agent that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: Information-Sensitive Cropping (ISC) and Self-Refining Dual Learning (SRDL). ISC dynamically identifies and prioritizes visually dense regions using a edge detection algorithm, enabling efficient processing by allocating more computational resources to areas with higher information density. SRDL enhances the agent's ability to handle complex tasks by leveraging a dual-learning loop, where improvements in referring (describing UI elements) reinforce grounding (locating elements) and vice versa, all without requiring additional annotated data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Iris achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with only 850K GUI annotations, outperforming methods using 10x more training data.

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing approaches treat stance detection as a classification problem, providing robust methodologies for modeling complex group interactions and advancing capabilities in natural language tasks. However, these methods often lack interpretability, limiting their ability to offer transparent and understandable justifications for predictions. This study adopts a generative approach, where stance predictions include explicit, interpretable rationales, and integrates them into smaller language models through single-task and multitask learning. We find that incorporating reasoning into stance detection enables the smaller model (FlanT5) to outperform GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance, achieving an improvement of up to 9.57%. Moreover, our results show that reasoning capabilities enhance multitask learning performance but may reduce effectiveness in single-task settings.

PAFFA constructs an 'Action Library', leveraging the parametric knowledge of the base LLM to pre-compute browser interaction patterns that generalize across tasks. By strategically re-using LLM inference across tasks - either via 'Dist-Map' for task-agnostic identification of key interactive web elements, or 'Unravel' for first-encounter, stateful exploration of novel tasks/sites) - PAFFA drastically reduces inference time tokens by 87% while maintaining robust performance (achieving 0.57 vs. 0.50 step accuracy compared to baseline). Further, Unravel's ability to update its action library based on explorations allows generalization and adaptation to unseen websites.

To address this, we introduce MemHunter, which trains a memory-inducing LLM and employs hypothesis testing to efficiently detect memorization at the dataset level, without requiring sample-specific memory inducing. Experiments on models like Pythia and Llama demonstrate that MemHunter can extract up to 40% more training data than existing methods under constrained time resources and reduce search time by up to 80% when integrated as a plug-in.

While large language models (LLMs) excel at synthesizing information, they do not provide reliable citation to sources, making it difficult to trace and verify the origins of the information they present. In contrast, search engines make sources readily accessible to users and place the burden of synthesizing information on the user. Through a survey, we find that users prefer search engines over LLMs for high-stakes queries, where concerns regarding information provenance outweigh the perceived utility of LLM responses. To examine the interplay between verifiability and utility of information-sharing tools, we introduce the extractive-abstractive spectrum, in which search engines and LLMs are extreme endpoints encapsulating multiple unexplored intermediate operating points. Search engines are extractive because they respond to queries with snippets of sources with links (citations) to the original webpages. LLMs are abstractive because they address queries with answers that synthesize and logically transform relevant information from training and in-context sources without reliable citation. We define five operating points that span the extractive-abstractive spectrum and conduct human evaluations on seven systems across four diverse query distributions that reflect real-world QA settings: web search, language simplification, multi-step reasoning, and medical advice. As outputs become more abstractive, we find that perceived utility improves by as much as 200%, while the proportion of properly cited sentences decreases by as much as 50% and users take up to 3 times as long to verify cited information.

This problem becomes particularly challenging when LLMs are used for informational tasks in rapidly evolving fields, such as Web search related to recent or unfolding events involving entities, where generating temporally relevant responses requires access to up-to-the-hour news sources. However, the information modeled by the parametric memory of LLMs is often outdated, and Web results from prototypical retrieval systems may fail to capture the latest relevant information and struggle to handle conflicting reports in evolving news. To address this challenge, we present the NEON framework, designed to extract emerging entity interactions -- such as events or activities -- as described in news articles. NEON constructs an entity-centric timestamped knowledge graph that captures such interactions, thereby facilitating enhanced QA capabilities related to news events. Our framework innovates by integrating open Information Extraction (openIE) style tuples into LLMs to enable in-context retrieval-augmented generation. This integration demonstrates substantial improvements in QA performance when tackling temporal, entity-centric search queries. Through NEON, LLMs can deliver more accurate, reliable, and up-to-date responses.","Submitted 20 November, 2024; v1 submitted 19 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024."

Historically, scripted automation has offered some assistance, but these solutions are often too rigid and task-specific, failing to adapt to the diverse needs of users. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised a more flexible approach, capable of interpreting natural language commands to navigate complex user interfaces. However, current LLMs often misinterpret user intent and have no fallback measures when user instructions do not directly align with the specific wording used in the Document Object Model (DOM). This research presents Dexterity Assist (DexAssist), a dual-LLM system designed to improve the reliability of automated user interface control. Both LLMs work iteratively to ensure successful task execution: the Navigator LLM generates actions based on user input, while the Support LLM assesses the success of these actions and provides continuous feedback based on the DOM content. Our framework displays an increase of ~36 percentage points in overall accuracy within the first iteration of the Support LLM, highlighting its effectiveness in resolving errors in real-time. The main contributions of this paper are the design of a novel dual LLM-based accessibility system, its implementation, and its initial evaluation using 3 e-commerce websites. We conclude by underscoring the potential to build on this framework by optimizing computation time and fine-tuning.","Submitted 5 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024."

However, these externally exposed HTTP services resent significant security risks. Although fuzzing has shown some effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities in IoT HTTP services, most state-of-the-art tools still rely on random mutation trategies, leading to difficulties in accurately understanding the HTTP protocol's structure and generating many invalid test cases. Furthermore, These fuzzers rely on a limited set of initial seeds for testing. While this approach initiates testing, the limited number and diversity of seeds hinder comprehensive coverage of complex scenarios in IoT HTTP services. In this paper, we investigate and find that large language models (LLMs) excel in parsing HTTP protocol data and analyzing code logic. Based on these findings, we propose a novel LLM-guided IoT HTTP fuzzing method, ChatHTTPFuzz, which automatically parses protocol fields and analyzes service code logic to generate protocol-compliant test cases. Specifically, we use LLMs to label fields in HTTP protocol data, creating seed templates. Second, The LLM analyzes service code to guide the generation of additional packets aligned with the code logic, enriching the seed templates and their field values. Finally, we design an enhanced Thompson sampling algorithm based on the exploration balance factor and mutation potential factor to schedule seed templates. We evaluate ChatHTTPFuzz on 14 different real-world IoT devices. It finds more vulnerabilities than SNIPUZZ, BOOFUZZ, and MUTINY. ChatHTTPFuzz has discovered 103 vulnerabilities, of which 68 are unique, and 23 have been assigned CVEs.","Submitted 18 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024."

However, despite this linguistic diversity, Indonesian languages remain underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research and technologies. In the past two years, several efforts have been conducted to construct NLP resources for Indonesian languages. However, most of these efforts have been focused on creating manual resources thus difficult to scale to more languages. Although many Indonesian languages do not have a web presence, locally there are resources that document these languages well in printed forms such as books, magazines, and newspapers. Digitizing these existing resources will enable scaling of Indonesian language resource construction to many more languages.

Yet, the full potential seems unleashed, as automated means for automatic population of said ontologies are lacking, and respective initiatives from the Semantic Web community are not necessarily connected: we propose to make scholarly data more sustainably accessible by leveraging Wikidata's infrastructure and automating its population in a sustainable manner through LLMs by tapping into unstructured sources like conference Web sites and proceedings texts as well as already existing structured conference datasets. While an initial analysis shows that Semantic Web conferences are only minimally represented in Wikidata, we argue that our methodology can help to populate, evolve and maintain scholarly data as a community within Wikidata. Our main contributions include (a) an analysis of ontologies for representing scholarly data to identify gaps and relevant entities/properties in Wikidata, (b) semi-automated extraction -- requiring (minimal) manual validation -- of conference metadata (e.g., acceptance rates, organizer roles, programme committee members, best paper awards, keynotes, and sponsors) from websites and proceedings texts using LLMs. Finally, we discuss (c) extensions to visualization tools in the Wikidata context for data exploration of the generated scholarly data. Our study focuses on data from 105 Semantic Web-related conferences and extends/adds more than 6000 entities in Wikidata.

In this article, we introduce a general framework that permits to build knowledge bases with an aid of LLMs, tailored for processing Web news. The framework applies a rule-based News Information Extractor (NewsIE) to news items for extracting their relational tuples, referred to as knowledge bases, which are then graph-convoluted with the implicit knowledge facts of news items obtained by LLMs, for their classification. It involves two lightweight components: 1) NewsIE: for extracting the structural information of every news item, in the form of relational tuples; 2) BERTGraph: for graph convoluting the implicit knowledge facts with relational tuples extracted by NewsIE.

Furthermore, the advent of REST API documentation languages, such as the OpenAPI Specification, has led to the emergence of many black-box REST API testing tools. However, these tools often focus on individual test elements in isolation (e.g., APIs, parameters, values), resulting in lower coverage and less effectiveness in fault detection. To address these limitations, we present AutoRestTest, the first black-box tool to adopt a dependency-embedded multi-agent approach for REST API testing that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a semantic property dependency graph (SPDG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach treats REST API testing as a separable problem, where four agents -- API, dependency, parameter, and value agents -- collaborate to optimize API exploration. LLMs handle domain-specific value generation, the SPDG model simplifies the search space for dependencies using a similarity score between API operations, and MARL dynamically optimizes the agents' behavior. Our evaluation of AutoRestTest on 12 real-world REST services shows that it outperforms the four leading black-box REST API testing tools, including those assisted by RESTGPT (which generates realistic test inputs using LLMs), in terms of code coverage, operation coverage, and fault detection. Notably, AutoRestTest is the only tool able to trigger an internal server error in the Spotify service. Our ablation study illustrates that each component of AutoRestTest -- the SPDG, the LLM, and the agent-learning mechanism -- contributes to its overall effectiveness.","Submitted 21 January, 2025; v1 submitted 11 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024."

Recent work has shown that incorporating advanced planning algorithms, e.g., tree search, is advantageous over reactive planning for web agents. However, unlike simulated sandbox environments, real-world environments such as the web are rife with irreversible actions. This undermines the feasibility of backtracking, a cornerstone of (tree) search. Overly relying on test-time search also hurts efficiency. We advocate model-based planning for web agents that employs a world model to simulate and deliberate over the outcome of each candidate action before committing to one. We systematically explore this paradigm by (1) Proposing a model-based planning framework, WebDreamer, which employs LLMs to serve as both world models and value functions; (2) Training specialized LLMs as world models with a scalable data synthesis pipeline. Empirical results demonstrate that WebDreamer achieves substantial performance improvements over reactive baselines. It is competitive, while being 4-5 times more efficient, with tree search in sandbox environments (VisualWebArena) and also works effectively on real-world websites (Online-Mind2Web and Mind2Web-Live). Furthermore, our trained world model, Dreamer-7B, performs comparable to GPT-4o, highlighting the potential of specialized world models for efficient and effective planning in complex web environments.","Submitted 1 April, 2025; v1 submitted 10 November, 2024; originally announced November 2024."

We integrate LLMs and search under a multi-hop evidence pursuit strategy. This strategy generates an initial question based on an input claim using a sequence to sequence model, searches and formulates an answer to the question, and iteratively generates follow-up questions to pursue the evidence that is missing using an LLM.

These methods predominantly utilize prompt learning to assess the relevance between queries and documents by generating a ranked list of potential documents. Despite their promise, the substantial costs associated with LLMs pose a significant challenge for their direct implementation in commercial search systems. To overcome this barrier and fully exploit the capabilities of LLMs for text ranking, we explore techniques to transfer the ranking expertise of LLMs to a more compact model similar to BERT, using a ranking loss to enable the deployment of less resource-intensive models. Specifically, we enhance the training of LLMs through Continued Pre-Training, taking the query as input and the clicked title and summary as output. We then proceed with supervised fine-tuning of the LLM using a rank loss, assigning the final token as a representative of the entire sentence. Given the inherent characteristics of autoregressive language models, only the final token </s> can encapsulate all preceding tokens. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid point-wise and margin MSE loss to transfer the ranking knowledge from LLMs to smaller models like BERT.

Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and a two-step block-tree-based pruning strategy, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information.

Retrieval and ranking models serve as the foundation for numerous applications, including web search, open domain QA, enterprise domain QA, and text-based recommender systems. Typically, these models undergo training on triplets consisting of binary relevance assignments, comprising one positive and one negative passage. However, their utilization involves a context where a significantly more nuanced understanding of relevance is necessary, especially when re-ranking a large pool of potentially relevant passages. Although collecting positive examples through user feedback like impressions or clicks is straightforward, identifying suitable negative pairs from a vast pool of possibly millions or even billions of documents possess a greater challenge. Generating a substantial number of negative pairs is often necessary to maintain the high quality of the model. Several approaches have been suggested in literature to tackle the issue of selecting suitable negative pairs from an extensive corpus. This study focuses on explaining the crucial role of hard negatives in the training process of cross-encoder models, specifically aiming to explain the performance gains observed with hard negative sampling compared to random sampling. We have developed a robust hard negative mining technique for efficient training of cross-encoder re-rank models on an enterprise dataset which has domain specific context. We provide a novel perspective to enhance retrieval models, ultimately influencing the performance of advanced LLM systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reasoning and Action Agents (ReAct). The proposed approach demonstrates that learning both similarity and dissimilarity simultaneously with cross-encoders improves performance of retrieval systems.","Submitted 18 October, 2024; originally announced November 2024."

However, existing LLMweb agents heavily rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs, while open LLMs lack the necessary decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WebRL, a self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning framework designed to train high-performance web agents using open LLMs. WebRL addresses three key challenges in building LLMweb agents, including the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift in online learning. Specifically, WebRL incorporates 1) a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from unsuccessful attempts, 2) a robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM), and 3) adaptive reinforcement learning strategies to ensure consistent improvements. We apply WebRL to transform open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents. On WebArena-Lite, WebRL improves the success rate of Llama-3.1-8B from 4.8% to 42.4%, and from 6.1% to 43% for GLM-4-9B. These open models significantly surpass the performance of GPT-4-Turbo (17.6%) and GPT-4o (13.9%) and outperform previous state-of-the-art web agents trained on open LLMs (AutoWebGLM, 18.2%).

The powerful inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in various fields, and the development potential of LLM-based agents can revolutionize the cybersecurity penetration testing industry. In this work, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end penetration testing benchmark using a real-world penetration testing environment to explore the capabilities of LLM-based agents in this domain. Our results reveal that the agents are familiar with the framework of penetration testing tasks, but they still face limitations in generating accurate commands and executing complete processes.

Amazon Web Services (AWS), the leading provider in this domain, provides the Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM), the most widely adopted configuration schema for configuring and managing serverless applications through a specified file. However, misconfigurations pose a significant challenge in serverless development. Traditional data-driven techniques may struggle with serverless applications because the complexity of serverless configurations hinders pattern recognition, and it is challenging to gather complete datasets that cover all possible configurations. Leveraging vast amounts of publicly available data during pre-training, LLMs can have the potential to assist in identifying and explaining misconfigurations in serverless applications.

Unlike traditional DNN model, the inference of LLM entails different iterations of forward computation for different queries, which result in efficiency challenges for existing run-to-completion batch-wise inference. Hence, some methods refine batch-wise inference to iteration-level by duplicating all nonlinear layers of LLM.

Therefore, we propose BATON, an efficient batch-wise LLM inference scheme by dynamically adjusting processing batch, which can achieve near-zero idle computations without incurring additional resource consumption. To do so, BATON 1) shapes the vectors involved in the inference of the newly inserted query and processing batch to align dimensions and generates a new attention mask based on vector shaping to ensure inference correctness, which enables query inserting without consuming additional resource; 2) embeds prefilled Keys and Values of the new query into the KV_Cache of the processing batch by leveraging the prefilling and decoding separation mechanism, eliminating idle computations to the batch introduced by the prefilling process of the new query.

However, it has been challenging to date to apply these methods to the full scale of LLM pretraining. In this paper, we refine existing gradient-based methods to work effectively at scale, allowing us to retrieve influential examples for an 8B-parameter language model from a pretraining corpus of over 160B tokens with no need for subsampling or pre-filtering. Our method combines several techniques, including optimizer state correction, a task-specific Hessian approximation, and normalized encodings, which we find to be critical for performance at scale. In quantitative evaluations on a fact tracing task, our method performs best at identifying examples that influence model predictions, but classical, model-agnostic retrieval methods such as BM25 still perform better at finding passages which explicitly contain relevant facts. These results demonstrate a misalignment between factual *attribution* and causal *influence*. With increasing model size and training tokens, we find that influence more closely aligns with factual attribution.

The sheer volume of known vulnerabilities complicates the detection of patterns for unknown threats. While LLMs can assist, they often hallucinate and lack alignment with recent threats. Over 25,000 vulnerabilities have been identified so far in 2024, which are introduced after popular LLMs' (e.g., GPT-4) training data cutoff. This raises a major challenge of leveraging LLMs in cybersecurity, where accuracy and up-to-date information are paramount. In this work, we aim to improve the adaptation of LLMs in vulnerability analysis by mimicking how analysts perform such tasks. We propose ProveRAG, an LLM-powered system designed to assist in rapidly analyzing CVEs with automated retrieval augmentation of web data while self-evaluating its responses with verifiable evidence. ProveRAG incorporates a self-critique mechanism to help alleviate omission and hallucination common in the output of LLMs applied in cybersecurity applications. The system cross-references data from verifiable sources (NVD and CWE), giving analysts confidence in the actionable insights provided. Our results indicate that ProveRAG excels in delivering verifiable evidence to the user with over 99% and 97% accuracy in exploitation and mitigation strategies, respectively. This system outperforms direct prompting and chunking retrieval in vulnerability analysis by overcoming temporal and context-window limitations. ProveRAG guides analysts to secure their systems more effectively while documenting the process for future audits.","Submitted 5 February, 2025; v1 submitted 22 October, 2024; originally announced October 2024."

Recently, Web agents have evolved from traditional agents to Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Web agents. Despite their success, existing LLM-based Web agents overlook the importance of personalized data (e.g., user profiles and historical Web behaviors) in assisting the understanding of users' personalized instructions and executing customized actions. To overcome the limitation, we first formulate the task of LLM-empowered personalized Web agents, which integrate personalized data and user instructions to personalize instruction comprehension and action execution. To address the absence of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, we construct a Personalized Web Agent Benchmark (PersonalWAB), featuring user instructions, personalized user data, Web functions, and two evaluation paradigms across three personalized Web tasks. Moreover, we propose a Personalized User Memory-enhanced Alignment (PUMA) framework to adapt LLMs to the personalized Web agent task. PUMA utilizes a memory bank with a task-specific retrieval strategy to filter relevant historical Web behaviors. Based on the behaviors, PUMA then aligns LLMs for personalized action execution through fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PUMA over existing Web agents on PersonalWAB.","Submitted 24 March, 2025; v1 submitted 22 October, 2024; originally announced October 2024."

While methods such as re-weighting and re-sampling help alleviate the imbalance issue, limited sample diversity continues to hinder models from learning robust and generalizable feature representations, particularly for tail classes. In contrast to existing methods, we offer a novel perspective on long-tail learning, inspired by an observation: datasets with finer granularity tend to be less affected by data imbalance. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon through both quantitative and qualitative studies, showing that increased granularity enhances the generalization of learned features in tail categories. Motivated by these findings, we propose a method to increase dataset granularity through category extrapolation. Specifically, we introduce open-set auxiliary classes that are visually similar to existing ones, aiming to enhance representation learning for both head and tail classes. This forms the core contribution and insight of our approach. To automate the curation of auxiliary data, we leverage large language models (LLMs) as knowledge bases to search for auxiliary categories and retrieve relevant images through web crawling. To prevent the overwhelming presence of auxiliary classes from disrupting training, we introduce a neighbor-silencing loss that encourages the model to focus on class discrimination within the target dataset. During inference, the classifier weights for auxiliary categories are masked out, leaving only the target class weights for use. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three standard long-tail benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, notably outperforming strong baseline methods that use the same amount of data. The code will be made publicly available.","Submitted 8 December, 2024; v1 submitted 21 October, 2024; originally announced October 2024."

While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler to reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the SuiGPT Move AI Decompiler (MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code with prompt engineering. Our evaluation shows that MAD's output successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 73.33% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, newer models tend to deliver improved performance, suggesting that MAD's approach will become increasingly effective as LLMs continue to advance. In a user study involving 12 developers, we found that MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, improving accessibility for understanding and auditing non-open-source smart contracts. Through qualitative interviews with these developers and Web3 projects, we further discussed the strengths and concerns of MAD. MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education.

These agent-based systems represent an emerging shift in personal computing. We contribute to the security foundations of agent-based systems and surface a new class of automatically computed obfuscated adversarial prompt attacks that violate the confidentiality and integrity of user resources connected to an LLM agent. We show how prompt optimization techniques can find such prompts automatically given the weights of a model. We demonstrate that such attacks transfer to production-level agents. For example, we show an information exfiltration attack on Mistral's LeChat agent that analyzes a user's conversation, picks out personally identifiable information, and formats it into a valid markdown command that results in leaking that data to the attacker's server. This attack shows a nearly 80% success rate in an end-to-end evaluation. We conduct a range of experiments to characterize the efficacy of these attacks and find that they reliably work on emerging agent-based systems like Mistral's LeChat, ChatGLM, and Meta's Llama.

In this work, we investigate the risks associated with misuse of LLM agents in cyberattacks involving personal data. Specifically, we aim to understand: 1) how potent LLM agents can be when directed to conduct cyberattacks, 2) how cyberattacks are enhanced by web-based tools, and 3) how affordable and easy it becomes to launch cyberattacks using LLM agents. We examine three attack scenarios: the collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), the generation of impersonation posts, and the creation of spear-phishing emails.

We study an open question in this work: does the desired safety refusal, typically enforced in chat contexts, generalize to non-chat and agentic use cases? Unlike chatbots, LLM agents equipped with general-purpose tools, such as web browsers and mobile devices, can directly influence the real world, making it even more crucial to refuse harmful instructions. In this work, we primarily focus on red-teaming browser agents, LLMs that manipulate information via web browsers.

Automating web tasks (like booking hotels within a budget) is increasingly sought after. Fulfilling practical needs, the web agent also serves as an important proof-of-concept example for various agent grounding scenarios, with its success promising advancements in many future applications. Prior research often handcrafts web agent strategies (e.g., prompting templates, multi-agent systems, search methods, etc.) and the corresponding in-context examples, which may not generalize well across all real-world scenarios. On the other hand, there has been limited study on the misalignment between a web agent's observation/action representation and the pre-training data of the LLM it's based on. This discrepancy is especially notable when LLMs are primarily trained for language completion rather than tasks involving embodied navigation actions and symbolic web elements. Our study enhances an LLM-based web agent by simply refining its observation and action space to better align with the LLM's capabilities. This approach enables our base agent to significantly outperform previous methods on a wide variety of web tasks. Specifically, on WebArena, a benchmark featuring general-purpose web interaction tasks, our agent AgentOccam surpasses the previous state-of-the-art and concurrent work by 9.8 (+29.4%) and 5.9 (+15.8%) absolute points respectively, and boosts the success rate by 26.6 points (+161%) over similar plain web agents with its observation and action space alignment.

Our work evaluates for the first time whether language models can also be compromised during pre-training, with a focus on the persistence of pre-training attacks after models are fine-tuned as helpful and harmless chatbots (i.e., after SFT and DPO). We pre-train a series of LLMs from scratch to measure the impact of a potential poisoning adversary under four different attack objectives (denial-of-service, belief manipulation, jailbreaking, and prompt stealing), and across a wide range of model sizes (from 600M to 7B). Our main result is that poisoning only 0.1% of a model's pre-training dataset is sufficient for three out of four attacks to measurably persist through post-training.

Access to large web-scale datasets has been a key factor in their success. However, concerns have been raised about the unauthorized use of copyrighted materials and potential copyright infringement. Existing methods, such as sample-level Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) and distribution-based dataset inference, distinguish member data (data used for training) and non-member data by leveraging the common observation that models tend to memorize and show greater confidence in member data. Nevertheless, these methods face challenges when applied to LLMs and VLMs, such as the requirement for ground-truth member data or non-member data that shares the same distribution as the test data. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset-level membership inference method based on Self-Comparison. We find that a member prefix followed by a non-member suffix (paraphrased from a member suffix) can further trigger the model's memorization on training data. Instead of directly comparing member and non-member data, we introduce paraphrasing to the second half of the sequence and evaluate how the likelihood changes before and after paraphrasing. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require access to ground-truth member data or non-member data in identical distribution, making it more practical.

Traditional IR systems, while effective in domains like web search, are constrained by their reliance on static, pre-defined information items. To this end, this paper introduces agentic information retrieval (Agentic IR), a transformative next-generation paradigm for IR driven by large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. The central shift in agentic IR is the evolving definition of ``information'' from static, pre-defined information items to dynamic, context-dependent information states. Information state refers to a particular information context that the user is right in within a dynamic environment, encompassing not only the acquired information items but also real-time user preferences, contextual factors, and decision-making processes. In such a way, traditional information retrieval, focused on acquiring relevant information items based on user queries, can be naturally extended to achieving the target information state given the user instruction, which thereby defines the agentic information retrieval. We systematically discuss agentic IR from various aspects, i.e., task formulation, architecture, evaluation, case studies, as well as challenges and future prospects. We believe that the concept of agentic IR introduced in this paper not only broadens the scope of information retrieval research but also lays the foundation for a more adaptive, interactive, and intelligent next-generation IR paradigm.","Submitted 22 February, 2025; v1 submitted 12 October, 2024; originally announced October 2024."

This distinction guided the development of specialized algorithmic solutions for both pipelines. In addition to describing the processing methodologies, we provide an in-depth analysis of the datasets, increasing transparency and alignment with European data regulations.

However, there is currently a lack of research specifically focused on vulnerabilities in the PHP language, and challenges in extracting samples and processing persist, hindering the model's ability to effectively capture the characteristics of specific vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present RealVul, the first LLM-based framework designed for PHP vulnerability detection, addressing these issues. By vulnerability candidate detection methods and employing techniques such as normalization, we can isolate potential vulnerability triggers while streamlining the code and eliminating unnecessary semantic information, enabling the model to better understand and learn from the generated vulnerability samples. We also address the issue of insufficient PHP vulnerability samples by improving data synthesis methods. To evaluate RealVul's performance, we conduct an extensive analysis using five distinct code LLMs on vulnerability data from 180 PHP projects. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in both effectiveness and generalization compared to existing methods, effectively boosting the vulnerability detection capabilities of these models.","Submitted 9 October, 2024; originally announced October 2024."

However, current research largely relies on manual, task-specific design, limiting their adaptability to novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory. Building on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework called AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module evolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To further accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses in-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web, embodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially outperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2% against best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate interpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic architecture and its impact on task performance. We believe that the modular design space and AgentSquare search framework offer a platform for fully exploiting the potential of prior successful designs and consolidating the collective efforts of research community.

Wilhelm, Sophia Stil, Kirk McInnis Knutsen, Eugenia H. Rho","Job interviews play a critical role in shaping one's career, yet practicing interview skills can be challenging, especially without access to human coaches or peers for feedback. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to enhance the interview practice experience. Yet, little research has explored the effectiveness and user perceptions of such systems or the benefits and challenges of using LLMs for interview practice. Furthermore, while prior work and recent commercial tools have demonstrated the potential of AI to assist with interview practice, they often deliver one-way feedback, where users only receive information about their performance. By contrast, dialogic feedback, a concept developed in learning sciences, is a two-way interaction feedback process that allows users to further engage with and learn from the provided feedback through interactive dialogue. This paper introduces Conversate, a web-based application that supports reflective learning in job interview practice by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for interactive interview simulations and dialogic feedback. To start the interview session, the user provides the title of a job position (e.g., entry-level software engineer) in the system. Then, our system will initialize the LLM agent to start the interview simulation by asking the user an opening interview question and following up with questions carefully adapted to subsequent user responses. After the interview session, our back-end LLM framework will then analyze the user's responses and highlight areas for improvement. Users can then annotate the transcript by selecting specific sections and writing self-reflections. Finally, the user can interact with the system for dialogic feedback, conversing with the LLM agent to learn from and iteratively refine their answers based on the agent's guidance.","Submitted 1 November, 2024; v1 submitted 7 October, 2024; originally announced October 2024."

To accomplish these tasks, the LLM often uses external data sources such as user documents, web retrieval, results from API calls, etc. This opens up new avenues for attackers to manipulate the LLM via prompt injection. Adversarial prompts can be injected into external data sources to override the system's intended instruction and instead execute a malicious instruction. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a new defense called SecAlign based on the technique of preference optimization. Our defense first constructs a preference dataset with prompt-injected inputs, secure outputs (ones that respond to the legitimate instruction), and insecure outputs (ones that respond to the injection). We then perform preference optimization on this dataset to teach the LLM to prefer the secure output over the insecure one. This provides the first known method that reduces the success rates of various prompt injections to around 0%, even against attacks much more sophisticated than ones seen during training. This indicates our defense generalizes well against unknown and yet-to-come attacks. Also, our defended models are still practical with similar utility to the one before our defensive training.

We propose LEAP, an iterative fine-tuning framework that continually improves LLM agents using feedback from AI expert teachers. Our key insight is to equip the expert teachers with a privileged state -- information that is available during training but hidden at test time. This allows even weak experts to provide precise guidance, significantly improving the student agent's performance without access to privileged information at test time. We evaluate LEAP on diverse decision-making benchmarks, including text-based games (ALFWorld), web navigation (WebShop), and interactive coding (Intercode Bash). Our experiments show that LEAP (1) outperforms behavior cloning and ReAct baselines (2) enables weak student models (e.g., Llama3-8B) to exceed the performance of strong teacher models (GPT4-o), and (3) allows weak models to self-improve using privileged versions of themselves.

We present CREATIVITY INDEX as the first step to quantify the linguistic creativity of a text by reconstructing it from existing text snippets on the web. CREATIVITY INDEX is motivated by the hypothesis that the seemingly remarkable creativity of LLMs may be attributable in large part to the creativity of human-written texts on the web. To compute CREATIVITY INDEX efficiently, we introduce DJ SEARCH, a novel dynamic programming algorithm that can search verbatim and near-verbatim matches of text snippets from a given document against the web. Experiments reveal that the CREATIVITY INDEX of professional human authors is on average 66.2% higher than that of LLMs, and that alignment reduces the CREATIVITY INDEX of LLMs by an average of 30.1%. In addition, we find that distinguished authors like Hemingway exhibit measurably higher CREATIVITY INDEX compared to other human writers. Finally, we demonstrate that CREATIVITY INDEX can be used as a surprisingly effective criterion for zero-shot machine text detection, surpassing the strongest existing zero-shot system, DetectGPT, by a significant margin of 30.2%, and even outperforming the strongest supervised system, GhostBuster, in five out of six domains.","Submitted 12 January, 2025; v1 submitted 5 October, 2024; originally announced October 2024."

We explored the potential of AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based experimental AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue, to potentially augment and support clinical decision-making in this challenging context. We curated a real-world dataset of 204 complex cases from a subspecialist cardiology practice, including results for electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, cardiac MRI, genetic tests, and cardiopulmonary stress tests. We developed a ten-domain evaluation rubric used by subspecialists to evaluate the quality of diagnosis and clinical management plans produced by general cardiologists or AMIE, the latter enhanced with web-search and self-critique capabilities. AMIE was rated superior to general cardiologists for 5 of the 10 domains (with preference ranging from 9% to 20%), and equivalent for the rest. Access to AMIE's response improved cardiologists' overall response quality in 63.7% of cases while lowering quality in just 3.4%. Cardiologists' responses with access to AMIE were superior to cardiologist responses without access to AMIE for all 10 domains. Qualitative examinations suggest AMIE and general cardiologist could complement each other, with AMIE thorough and sensitive, while general cardiologist concise and specific.

Current methods for citation or attribution, such as those employed by tools like Perplexity.ai and Bing Search-integrated LLMs, attempt to ground responses by providing real-time search results and citations. However, so far, these approaches suffer from issues such as hallucinations, biases, surface-level relevance matching, and the complexity of managing vast, unfiltered knowledge sources. While tools like Perplexity.ai dynamically integrate web-based information and citations, they often rely on inconsistent sources such as blog posts or unreliable sources, which limits their overall reliability.

NesyAI offers transparent, interpretable, and dynamic reasoning processes, addressing the limitations of current attribution methods by incorporating structured symbolic knowledge with flexible, neural-based learning.

This paper demonstrates that GPT-4o is remarkably effective at identifying high-quality training data, but its prohibitive cost makes it impractical at web-scale. We propose SIEVE, a lightweight alternative that matches GPT-4o accuracy at less than 1\% of the cost. SIEVE can perform up to 500 filtering operations for the cost of one GPT-4o filtering call. The key to SIEVE is a seamless integration of GPT-4o and lightweight text classification models, using active learning to fine-tune these models in the background with a small number of calls to GPT-4o. Once trained, it performs as well as GPT-4o at a tiny fraction of the cost.

However, the limited context awareness of LLMs degrades their performance on RAG tasks. Existing methods to enhance context awareness are often inefficient, incurring time or memory overhead during inference, and many are tailored to specific position embeddings. In this paper, we propose Position-Embedding-Agnostic attention Re-weighting (PEAR), which enhances the context awareness of LLMs with zero inference overhead. Specifically, on a proxy task focused on context copying, we first detect heads which suppress the models' context awareness thereby diminishing RAG performance. To weaken the impact of these heads, we re-weight their outputs with learnable coefficients. The LLM (with frozen parameters) is optimized by adjusting these coefficients to minimize loss on the proxy task. As a result, the coefficients are optimized to values less than one, thereby reducing their tendency to suppress RAG performance. During inference, the optimized coefficients are fixed to re-weight these heads, regardless of the specific task at hand. Our proposed PEAR offers two major advantages over previous approaches: (1) It introduces zero additional inference overhead in terms of memory usage or inference time, while outperforming competitive baselines in accuracy and efficiency across various RAG tasks. (2) It is independent of position embedding algorithms, ensuring broader applicability.","Submitted 7 October, 2024; v1 submitted 29 September, 2024; originally announced September 2024."

Doctors need to conduct thorough consultations, which include diagnosing the patient's condition, providing treatment advice, and transcribing detailed notes into medical records. In regions with diverse linguistic backgrounds, doctors often have to ask clarifying questions, further prolonging the process. While diagnosing is essential, transcription and summarization can often be automated using AI to improve time efficiency and help doctors enhance care quality and enable early diagnosis and intervention. This paper proposes a solution using a localized large language model (LLM) to transcribe, translate, and summarize doctor-patient conversations. We utilize the Whisper model for transcription and GPT-3 to summarize them into the ePuskemas medical records format. This system is implemented as an add-on to an existing web browser extension, allowing doctors to fill out patient forms while talking.

Commonly, contexts are prepared through either retrieval-based or generation-based methods. The former involves retrieving relevant documents from a corpus like Wikipedia, whereas the latter uses generative models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the context. In this paper, we introduce a novel context preparation approach called HINTQA, which employs Automatic Hint Generation (HG) techniques. Unlike traditional methods, HINTQA prompts LLMs to produce hints about potential answers for the question rather than generating relevant context. We evaluate our approach across three QA datasets including TriviaQA, NaturalQuestions, and Web Questions, examining how the number and order of hints impact performance. Our findings show that the HINTQA surpasses both retrieval-based and generation-based approaches.

However, accuracy is still far from satisfactory, partly due to a lack of large-scale, direct demonstrations for digital tasks. Obtaining supervised data from humans is costly, and automatic data collection through exploration or reinforcement learning relies on complex environmental and content setup, resulting in datasets that lack comprehensive coverage of various scenarios. On the other hand, there is abundant knowledge that may indirectly assist task completion, such as online tutorials that were created for human consumption. In this work, we present Synatra, an approach that effectively transforms this indirect knowledge into direct supervision at scale. We define different types of indirect knowledge, and carefully study the available sources to obtain it, methods to encode the structure of direct demonstrations, and finally methods to transform indirect knowledge into direct demonstrations. We use 100k such synthetically-created demonstrations to finetune a 7B CodeLlama, and demonstrate that the resulting agent surpasses all comparably sized models on three web-based task benchmarks Mind2Web, MiniWoB++ and WebArena, as well as surpassing GPT-3.5 on WebArena and Mind2Web. In addition, while synthetic demonstrations prove to be only 3% the cost of human demonstrations (at $0.031 each), we show that the synthetic demonstrations can be more effective than an identical number of human demonstrations collected from limited domains.","Submitted 27 November, 2024; v1 submitted 23 September, 2024; originally announced September 2024."

One emerging application of LLMs, navigating through websites and interacting with UI elements across various web pages, remains somewhat underexplored. We introduce Steward, a novel LLM-powered web automation tool designed to serve as a cost-effective, scalable, end-to-end solution for automating web interactions. Traditional browser automation frameworks like Selenium, Puppeteer, and Playwright are not scalable for extensive web interaction tasks, such as studying recommendation algorithms on platforms like YouTube and Twitter. These frameworks require manual coding of interactions, limiting their utility in large-scale or dynamic contexts. Steward addresses these limitations by integrating LLM capabilities with browser automation, allowing for natural language-driven interaction with websites. Steward operates by receiving natural language instructions and reactively planning and executing a sequence of actions on websites, looping until completion, making it a practical tool for developers and researchers to use. It achieves high efficiency, completing actions in 8.52 to 10.14 seconds at a cost of 0.028 per action or an average of 
0.18 per task, which is further reduced to 4.8 seconds and $0.022 through a caching mechanism. It runs tasks on real websites with a 40% completion success rate.

However, measuring agent performance in realistic environments remains a challenge since: (i) most benchmarks are limited to specific modalities or domains (e.g. text-only, web navigation, Q&A, coding) and (ii) full benchmark evaluations are slow (on order of magnitude of days) given the multi-step sequential nature of tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce the Windows Agent Arena: a reproducible, general environment focusing exclusively on the Windows operating system (OS) where agents can operate freely within a real Windows OS and use the same wide range of applications, tools, and web browsers available to human users when solving tasks. We adapt the OSWorld framework (Xie et al., 2024) to create 150+ diverse Windows tasks across representative domains that require agent abilities in planning, screen understanding, and tool usage.

To assess the possible application of this retrieval augmented generation (RAG) workflow on biosciences content, we evaluated 1,719 positive statements from the BioRED dataset and the same number of newly generated negative statements. The resulting precision is 88 %, and recall is 44 %. This indicates that the method requires human oversight. We also evaluated the method on the SNLI dataset, which allowed us to compare our approach with models specifically tuned for the natural language inference task.

Our work is based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method.

However, challenges persist, especially when accuracy is critical, as in the biomedical domain. A key issue is the hallucination problem, where models generate information unsupported by the underlying data, potentially leading to dangerous misinformation. This paper presents a novel approach designed to bridge this gap by combining Large Language Models (LLM) and Knowledge Graphs (KG) to improve the accuracy and reliability of question-answering systems, on the example of a biomedical KG. Built on the LangChain framework, our method incorporates a query checker that ensures the syntactical and semantic validity of LLM-generated queries, which are then used to extract information from a Knowledge Graph, substantially reducing errors like hallucinations. We evaluated the overall performance using a new benchmark dataset of 50 biomedical questions, testing several LLMs, including GPT-4 Turbo and llama3:70b. Our results indicate that while GPT-4 Turbo outperforms other models in generating accurate queries, open-source models like llama3:70b show promise with appropriate prompt engineering. To make this approach accessible, a user-friendly web-based interface has been developed, allowing users to input natural language queries, view generated and corrected Cypher queries, and verify the resulting paths for accuracy.

We propose Corpus Retrieval and Augmentation for Fine-Tuning (CRAFT), a method for generating synthetic datasets, given a small number of user-written few-shots that demonstrate the task to be performed. Given the few-shot examples, we use large-scale public web-crawled corpora and similarity-based document retrieval to find other relevant human-written documents. Lastly, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) augment the retrieved documents into custom-formatted task samples, which then can be used for fine-tuning. We demonstrate that CRAFT can efficiently generate large-scale task-specific training datasets for four diverse tasks: biology question-answering (QA), medicine QA and commonsense QA as well as summarization. Our experiments show that CRAFT-based models outperform or achieve comparable performance to general LLMs for QA tasks, while CRAFT-based summarization models outperform models trained on human-curated data by 46 preference points.","Submitted 3 September, 2024; originally announced September 2024."

LLMs typically show strong results on these benchmarks, leading to a belief that LLMs are effective at text-to-SQL tasks. However, how these results transfer to enterprise settings is unclear because tables in enterprise databases might differ substantially from web tables in structure and content. To contend with this problem, we introduce a new dataset BEAVER, the first enterprise text-to-SQL benchmark sourced from real private enterprise data warehouses. This dataset includes natural language queries and their correct SQL statements, which we collected from actual query logs. We then benchmark off-the-shelf LLMs on this dataset. LLMs perform poorly, even when augmented with standard prompt engineering and RAG techniques. We identify three main reasons for the poor performance: (1) schemas of enterprise tables are more complex than the schemas in public data, resulting in SQL-generation tasks intrinsically harder; (2) business-oriented questions are often more complex, requiring joins over multiple tables, aggregations, and nested queries; (3) public LLMs cannot train on private enterprise data warehouses that are not publicly accessible, and therefore it is difficult for the model to learn to solve (1) and (2). We believe BEAVER will facilitate future research in building text-to-SQL systems that perform better in enterprise settings.","Submitted 20 January, 2025; v1 submitted 3 September, 2024; originally announced September 2024."

This opens up a new attack surface: Untrusted web content is passed through to the GPU stack, which traditionally has been optimized for performance instead of security. Worsening the problem, most of WebGPU cannot be run in the tightly sandboxed process that manages other web content, which eases the attacker's path to compromising the client machine. Contrasting its importance, WebGPU shader processing has received surprisingly little attention from the automated testing community. Part of the reason is that shader translators expect highly structured and statically typed input, which renders typical fuzzing mutations ineffective. Complicating testing further, shader translation consists of a complex multi-step compilation pipeline, each stage presenting unique requirements and challenges. In this paper, we propose DarthShader, the first language fuzzer that combines mutators based on an intermediate representation with those using a more traditional abstract syntax tree. The key idea is that the individual stages of the shader compilation pipeline are susceptible to different classes of faults, requiring entirely different mutation strategies for thorough testing. By fuzzing the full pipeline, we ensure that we maintain a realistic attacker model. In an empirical evaluation, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers regarding code coverage. Furthermore, an extensive ablation study validates our key design. DarthShader found a total of 39 software faults in all modern browsers -- Chrome, Firefox, and Safari -- that prior work missed. For 15 of them, the Chrome team assigned a CVE, acknowledging the impact of our results.","Submitted 3 September, 2024; originally announced September 2024."

These capabilities pave the way for transforming LLMs from mere chatbots into general-purpose agents capable of interacting with the real world. This paper explores the concept of using a language model as the core component of an operating system (OS), effectively acting as a CPU that processes data stored in a context window, which functions as RAM. A key challenge in realizing such an LM OS is managing the life-long context and ensuring statefulness across sessions, a feature limited by the current session-based interaction paradigm due to context window size limit. To address this, we introduce compressor-retriever, a model-agnostic architecture designed for life-long context management. Unlike other long-context solutions such as retrieval-augmented generation, our approach exclusively uses the base model's forward function to compress and retrieve context, ensuring end-to-end differentiability. Preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in in-context learning tasks, marking a step towards the development of a fully stateful LLM OS.

However, contemporary LLM-based code completion systems often hallucinate broken code because they lack appropriate context, particularly when working with definitions not in the training data nor near the cursor. This paper demonstrates that tight integration with the type and binding structure of a language, as exposed by its language server, can address this contextualization problem in a token-efficient manner. In short, we contend that AIs need IDEs, too! In particular, we integrate LLM code generation into the Hazel live program sketching environment. The Hazel Language Server identifies the type and typing context of the hole being filled, even in the presence of errors, ensuring that a meaningful program sketch is always available. This allows prompting with codebase-wide contextual information not lexically local to the cursor, nor necessarily in the same file, but that is likely to be semantically local to the developer's goal. Completions synthesized by the LLM are then iteratively refined via further dialog with the language server. To evaluate these techniques, we introduce MVUBench, a dataset of model-view-update (MVU) web applications. These applications serve as challenge problems due to their reliance on application-specific data structures. We find that contextualization with type definitions is particularly impactful. After introducing our ideas in the context of Hazel we duplicate our techniques and port MVUBench to TypeScript in order to validate the applicability of these methods to higher-resource languages. Finally, we outline ChatLSP, a conservative extension to the Language Server Protocol (LSP) that language servers can implement to expose capabilities that AI code completion systems of various designs can use to incorporate static context when generating prompts for an LLM.","Submitted 1 September, 2024; originally announced September 2024."

Methods: We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions, 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next, we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions), including GPT (3.5, 4, 4o, 4omini), Claude (3, 3.5), Gemini (1.0), Mistral, Llama (2, 3, 3.1), Mixtral, and Phi (3), across different interfaces (web and API), computing environments (cloud and local), and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally, we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline. Results: Among the proprietary models, GPT-4o (73.7%) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0%) achieved the highest accuracy, outperforming the top open-source models: Llama3.1-405b (64%), Llama3.1-70b (58.3%), and Mixtral-8x7b (54.3%). Among the quantized open-source models, the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7%) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2-7b, Llama2--13b, and Gemma2-9b. Notably, VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast, a 10% increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by human-crafted image descriptions. Conclusion: In conclusion, while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning, the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations, encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.","Submitted 4 September, 2024; v1 submitted 25 August, 2024; originally announced September 2024."

Unlike web tracking, data collection through web forms is explicit and contextualized. Users (i) are asked to input specific personal information types, and (ii) know the specific context (i.e., on which website and for what purpose). For web forms to be trusted by users, they must meet the common sense standards of appropriate data collection practices within a particular context (i.e., privacy norms). In this paper, we extract the privacy norms embedded within web forms through a measurement study. First, we build a specialized crawler to discover web forms on websites. We run it on 11,500 popular websites, and we create a dataset of 293K web forms. Second, to process data of this scale, we develop a cost-efficient way to annotate web forms with form types and personal information types, using text classifiers trained with assistance of large language models (LLMs). Third, by analyzing the annotated dataset, we reveal common patterns of data collection practices. We find that (i) these patterns are explained by functional necessities and legal obligations, thus reflecting privacy norms, and that (ii) deviations from the observed norms often signal unnecessary data collection. In addition, we analyze the privacy policies that accompany web forms. We show that, despite their wide adoption and use, there is a disconnect between privacy policy disclosures and the observed privacy norms.","Submitted 29 August, 2024; originally announced August 2024."

Existing LLM-based web agents typically rely on rigid, expert-designed policies specific to certain states and actions, which lack the flexibility and generalizability needed to adapt to unseen tasks. In contrast, humans excel by exploring unknowns, continuously adapting strategies, and resolving ambiguities through exploration. To emulate human-like adaptability, web agents need strategic exploration and complex decision-making. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is well-suited for this, but classical MCTS struggles with vast action spaces, unpredictable state transitions, and incomplete information in web tasks. In light of this, we develop WebPilot, a multi-agent system with a dual optimization strategy that improves MCTS to better handle complex web environments. Specifically, the Global Optimization phase involves generating a high-level plan by breaking down tasks into manageable subtasks and continuously refining this plan, thereby focusing the search process and mitigating the challenges posed by vast action spaces in classical MCTS. Subsequently, the Local Optimization phase executes each subtask using a tailored MCTS designed for complex environments, effectively addressing uncertainties and managing incomplete information. Experimental results on WebArena and MiniWoB++ demonstrate the effectiveness of WebPilot. Notably, on WebArena, WebPilot achieves SOTA performance with GPT-4, achieving a 93% relative increase in success rate over the concurrent tree search-based method.

Drawing on a survey of ChatGPT users and applying the mechanisms and conditions framework of affordances, we demonstrate that these features encourage simple, frequent, and performance-focused feedback while discouraging collective input and discussions among users. We argue that this feedback format significantly constrains user participation, reinforcing power imbalances between users, the public, and companies developing LLMs. Our analysis contributes to the growing body of literature on participatory AI by critically examining the limitations of existing feedback processes and proposing directions for their redesign. To enable more meaningful public participation in AI development, we advocate for a shift away from processes focused on aligning model outputs with specific user preferences.

Existing multimodal fake news detection methods can generally be classified into knowledge-based and semantic-based approaches. However, these methods are heavily rely on human expertise and feedback, lacking flexibility. To address this challenge, we propose a Dynamic Analysis and Adaptive Discriminator (DAAD) approach for fake news detection. For knowledge-based methods, we introduce the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to leverage the self-reflective capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for prompt optimization, providing richer, domain-specific details and guidance to the LLMs, while enabling more flexible integration of LLM comment on news content. For semantic-based methods, we define four typical deceit patterns: emotional exaggeration, logical inconsistency, image manipulation, and semantic inconsistency, to reveal the mechanisms behind fake news creation. To detect these patterns, we carefully design four discriminators and expand them in depth and breadth, using the soft-routing mechanism to explore optimal detection models. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

Traditionally, students relied heavily on web search for coding assistance, but this has shifted with the adoption of LLMs like ChatGPT. However, the comparative process and outcomes of using web search versus LLMs for coding help remain underexplored. To address this, we conducted a randomized interview study in a database classroom to compare web search and LLMs, including a publicly available LLM (ChatGPT) and an instructor-tuned LLM, for writing SQL queries. Our findings indicate that using an instructor-tuned LLM required significantly more interactions than both ChatGPT and web search, but resulted in a similar number of edits to the final SQL query. No significant differences were found in the quality of the final SQL queries between conditions, although the LLM conditions directionally showed higher query quality. Furthermore, students using instructor-tuned LLM reported a lower mental demand. These results have implications for learning and productivity in programming education.","Submitted 15 August, 2024; originally announced August 2024."

In the offline environment, multimodal dialogue functions are also being realized, such as guidance by Artificial Intelligence agents (AI agents) using tablet terminals and dialogue systems in the form of LLMs mounted on robots. In this multimodal dialogue, mutual emotion recognition between the AI and the user will become important. So far, there have been methods for expressing emotions on the part of the AI agent or for recognizing them using textual or voice information of the user's utterances, but methods for AI agents to recognize emotions from the user's facial expressions have not been studied. In this study, we examined whether or not LLM-based AI agents can interact with users according to their emotional states by capturing the user in dialogue with a camera, recognizing emotions from facial expressions, and adding such emotion information to prompts. The results confirmed that AI agents can have conversations according to the emotional state for emotional states with relatively high scores, such as Happy and Angry.","Submitted 18 February, 2025; v1 submitted 15 August, 2024; originally announced August 2024."

However, LLMs are prone to produce factually incorrect information and often produce ""phantom"" content that undermines their reliability, which poses a serious challenge for their deployment in real-world scenarios. Enhancing LLMs by combining external databases and information retrieval mechanisms is an effective path. To address the above challenges, we propose a new approach called WeKnow-RAG, which integrates Web search and Knowledge Graphs into a ""Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)"" system. First, the accuracy and reliability of LLM responses are improved by combining the structured representation of Knowledge Graphs with the flexibility of dense vector retrieval. WeKnow-RAG then utilizes domain-specific knowledge graphs to satisfy a variety of queries and domains, thereby improving performance on factual information and complex reasoning tasks by employing multi-stage web page retrieval techniques using both sparse and dense retrieval methods. Our approach effectively balances the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval, thus improving the overall retrieval process.

Traditional supervised pre-training on static datasets falls short in enabling autonomous agent capabilities needed to perform complex decision-making in dynamic settings like web navigation. Previous attempts to bridge this ga-through supervised fine-tuning on curated expert demonstrations-often suffer from compounding errors and limited exploration data, resulting in sub-optimal policy outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a framework that combines guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) search with a self-critique mechanism and iterative fine-tuning on agent interactions using an off-policy variant of the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm. Our method allows LLM agents to learn effectively from both successful and unsuccessful trajectories, thereby improving their generalization in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.

This research proposes a pipeline that leverages the power of LLMs and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation related framework to construct high-quality instruction datasets for fine-tuning on specific domains using custom document collections. By ingesting domain-specific documents, the pipeline generates relevant and contextually appropriate instructions, thus effectively creating a comprehensive dataset for fine-tuning LLMs on the target domain. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional dataset creation methods, which often rely on manual curation or web-scraping techniques that may introduce noise and irrelevant data. Notably, our pipeline offers a dynamic solution that can quickly adapt to updates or modifications in the domain-specific document collection, eliminating the need for complete retraining. Additionally, it addresses the challenge of data scarcity by enabling the generation of instruction datasets from a limited set of initial documents, rendering it suitable for unpopular or specialized domains where comprehensive datasets are scarce.

To bridge this gap, we introduce PsyDI, a personalized and progressively in-depth chatbot designed for psychological measurements, exemplified by its application in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) framework. PsyDI leverages user-related multi-modal information and engages in customized, multi-turn interactions to provide personalized, easily accessible measurements, while ensuring precise MBTI type determination. To address the challenge of unquantifiable psychological traits, we introduce a novel training paradigm that involves learning the ranking of proxy variables associated with these traits, culminating in a robust score model for MBTI measurements.

In many applications, these pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on task specific datasets, which can further contribute to biases. This paper studies the extent of biases absorbed by LLMs during pre-training as well as task-specific behaviour after fine-tuning. We found that controlled interventions on pre-trained LLMs, prior to fine-tuning, have minimal effect on lowering biases in classifiers. However, the biases present in domain-specific datasets play a much bigger role, and hence mitigating them at this stage has a bigger impact.

We train a model to predict transitions between events from their LLM embeddings, which can even generalize to unseen events by learning from diverse training data. In web-marketing applications, we leverage this transition prediction model to simulate how users might react differently when new campaigns or products are presented to them.

Inspired by the remarkable progress of Large Language Models, recent works attempt to solve this task by combining LLMs and search engines. However, these methods still obtain unsatisfying performance due to three challenges: (1) complex requests often cannot be accurately and completely retrieved by the search engine once (2) corresponding information to be integrated is spread over multiple web pages along with massive noise, and (3) a large number of web pages with long contents may quickly exceed the maximum context length of LLMs. Inspired by the cognitive process when humans solve these problems, we introduce MindSearch to mimic the human minds in web information seeking and integration, which can be instantiated by a simple yet effective LLM-based multi-agent framework. The WebPlanner models the human mind of multi-step information seeking as a dynamic graph construction process: it decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher. Tasked with each sub-question, WebSearcher performs hierarchical information retrieval with search engines and collects valuable information for WebPlanner. The multi-agent design of MindSearch enables the whole framework to seek and integrate information parallelly from larger-scale (e.g., more than 300) web pages in 3 minutes, which is worth 3 hours of human effort. MindSearch demonstrates significant improvement in the response quality in terms of depth and breadth, on both close-set and open-set QA problems. Besides, responses from MindSearch based on InternLM2.5-7B are preferable by humans to ChatGPT-Web and Perplexity.ai applications, which implies that MindSearch can already deliver a competitive solution to the proprietary AI search engine.","Submitted 29 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

Critical care medicine (CCM) provides diagnosis and treatment for critically ill patients who often require intensive monitoring and interventions in intensive care units (ICUs). Can LLMs be applied to CCM? Are LLMs just like stochastic parrots or ICU experts in assisting clinical decision-making? This scoping review aims to provide a panoramic portrait of the application of LLMs in CCM. Literature in seven databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, were searched from January 1, 2019, to June 10, 2024. Peer-reviewed journal and conference articles that discussed the application of LLMs in critical care settings were included. From an initial 619 articles, 24 were selected for final review. This review grouped applications of LLMs in CCM into three categories: clinical decision support, medical documentation and reporting, and medical education and doctor-patient communication. LLMs have advantages in handling unstructured data and do not require manual feature engineering. Meanwhile, applying LLMs to CCM faces challenges, including hallucinations, poor interpretability, bias and alignment challenges, and privacy and ethics issues. Future research should enhance model reliability and interpretability, integrate up-to-date medical knowledge, and strengthen privacy and ethical guidelines. As LLMs evolve, they could become key tools in CCM to help improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare delivery.

To address these challenges, we develop several new features and components for AgentScope, a user-friendly multi-agent platform, enhancing its convenience and flexibility for supporting very large-scale multi-agent simulations. Specifically, we propose an actor-based distributed mechanism as the underlying technological infrastructure towards great scalability and high efficiency, and provide flexible environment support for simulating various real-world scenarios, which enables parallel execution of multiple agents, automatic workflow conversion for distributed deployment, and both inter-agent and agent-environment interactions. Moreover, we integrate an easy-to-use configurable tool and an automatic background generation pipeline in AgentScope, simplifying the process of creating agents with diverse yet detailed background settings.

However, code execution, especially partial or arbitrary code execution, is a non-trivial task due to missing definitions and complex third-party dependencies. To make partial code (such as code snippets posted on the web or code fragments deep inside complex software projects) executable, the existing study has proposed a machine learning model to predict the undefined element types and inject the pre-defined dummy values into execution. However, the performance of their tool is limited due to its simply designed dummy values and the inability to continue learning. In this paper, we design and implement a novel framework, named SelfPiCo (Self Guided Partial Code Executor), to dynamically guide partial code execution by incorporating the open-source LLM (i.e., Code Llama) within an interactive loop. Particularly, SelfPiCo leverages few-shot in-context learning and chain-of-thought reasoning to elicit human knowledge and logical reasoning based on fine-tuning the Code Llama model. SelfPiCo continuously learns from code execution results and refines its predictions step after step. Our evaluations demonstrate that SelfPiCo can execute 72.7% and 83.3% of all lines in the open-source code and Stack Overflow snippets, outperforming the most recent state-of-the-art Lexecutor by 37.9% and 33.5%, respectively.

We introduce folktexts, a software package to systematically generate risk scores using LLMs, and evaluate them against US Census data products. A flexible API enables the use of different prompting schemes, local or web-hosted models, and diverse census columns that can be used to compose custom prediction tasks.

From qualitative analysis of 250 conversational turns from an in-lab user evaluation of Naver Cue:, a commercial conversational search engine, we propose a taxonomy of 18 users' follow-up query patterns from conversational search, comprising two major axes: (1) users' motivations behind continuing conversations (N = 7) and (2) actions of follow-up queries (N = 11). Compared to the existing literature on query reformulations, we uncovered a new set of motivations and actions behind follow-up queries, including asking for subjective opinions or providing natural language feedback on the engine's responses.

Users interacted with a novel web-based AI system designed to ask follow-up questions. Users requested documents they would like the AI to produce. The AI then generated follow-up questions to clarify the user's needs or offer additional insights before generating the requested documents. After answering the questions, users were shown a document generated using both the initial request and the questions and answers, and a document generated using only the initial request. Users indicated which document they preferred and gave feedback about their experience with the question-answering process. The findings of this study show clear benefits to question-asking both in document preference and in the qualitative user experience. This study further shows that users found more value in questions which were thought-provoking, open-ended, or offered unique insights into the user's request as opposed to simple information-gathering questions.","Submitted 15 August, 2024; v1 submitted 27 June, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

Such misalignment may lead agents to unintentionally execute critical actions that carry negative outcomes (e.g., accidentally triggering a ""buy-now"" in web shopping), resulting in undesirable or even irreversible consequences. Although addressing these issues is crucial, the preemptive detection and correction of misaligned actions remains relatively underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to detect misaligned actions before execution. Once the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts users for timely correction, preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing the reliability of LLM agents' decision-making processes. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate that InferAct achieves up to 20% improvements on Marco-F1 against baselines in misaligned action detection. An in-depth evaluation of misalignment correction further highlights InferAct's effectiveness in improving agent alignment.","Submitted 27 December, 2024; v1 submitted 16 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

However, these datasets typically exhibit a geographical bias towards English-speaking Western countries. This results in LLMs producing biased or hallucinated responses to queries that require answers localized to other geographical regions. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark named LoFTI (Localization and Factuality Transfer to Indian Locales) that can be used to evaluate an LLM's localization and factual text transfer capabilities. LoFTI consists of factual statements about entities in source and target locations; the source locations are spread across the globe and the target locations are all within India with varying degrees of hyperlocality (country, states, cities). The entities span a wide variety of categories. We use LoFTI to evaluate Mixtral, GPT-4 and two other Mixtral-based approaches well-suited to the task of localized factual transfer. We demonstrate that LoFTI is a high-quality evaluation benchmark and all the models, including GPT-4, produce skewed results across varying levels of hyperlocality.","Submitted 16 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data. Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning. This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques. To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort. Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy. This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts. The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost. Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection.","Submitted 16 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

Leveraging the extensive knowledge of CLIP models, NOVIC harnesses the embedding space to enable zero-shot transfer from pure text to images. Traditional CLIP models, despite their ability for open vocabulary classification, require an exhaustive prompt of potential class labels, restricting their application to images of known content or context. To address this, we propose an ""object decoder"" model that is trained on a large-scale 92M-target dataset of templated object noun sets and LLM-generated captions to always output the object noun in question. This effectively inverts the CLIP text encoder and allows textual object labels from essentially the entire English language to be generated directly from image-derived embedding vectors, without requiring any a priori knowledge of the potential content of an image, and without any label biases. The trained decoders are tested on a mix of manually and web-curated datasets, as well as standard image classification benchmarks, and achieve fine-grained prompt-free prediction scores of up to 87.5%, a strong result considering the model must work for any conceivable image and without any contextual clues.","Submitted 26 November, 2024; v1 submitted 15 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

Consequently, these systems have been carefully designed to tackle challenges such as file parsing, metadata extraction, multi-modal information understanding and long-context reading. However, no current benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in such scenarios, where a raw file and questions are provided as input, and a corresponding response is expected as output. In this paper, we introduce DocBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based document reading systems. Our benchmark involves a meticulously crafted process, including the recruitment of human annotators and the generation of synthetic questions. It includes 229 real documents and 1,102 questions, spanning across five different domains and four major types of questions. We evaluate both proprietary LLM-based systems accessible via web interfaces or APIs, and a parse-then-read pipeline employing open-source LLMs. Our evaluations reveal noticeable gaps between existing LLM-based document reading systems and human performance, underscoring the challenges of developing proficient systems. To summarize, DocBench aims to establish a standardized benchmark for evaluating LLM-based document reading systems under diverse real-world scenarios, thereby guiding future advancements in this research area.","Submitted 15 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

While product search is useful for shoppers to find the actual products meeting their requirements in the catalog, information seeking systems can be utilized to answer any questions they may have to refine those requirements. The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up an opportunity to bridge the gap between the two tasks to help customers achieve their goals quickly and effectively by integrating conversational QA within product search. In this paper, we propose to recommend users Question-Answer (Q&A) pairs that are relevant to their product search and can help them make a purchase decision. We discuss the different aspects of the problem including the requirements and characteristics of the Q&A pairs, their generation, and the optimization of the Q&A recommendation task.

However, online catalogues merely offer descriptive metadata for these documents, relegating discussions about their authenticity to free-text formats, making it difficult to study these assessments at scale. This study explores the generation of structured data about documents' authenticity assessment from natural language texts. Our pipeline exploits Large Language Models (LLMs) to select, extract and classify relevant claims about the topic without the need for training, and Semantic Web technologies to structure and type-validate the LLM's results. The final output is a catalogue of documents whose authenticity has been debated, along with scholars' opinions on their authenticity.

This practice ties users' personally identifiable information (PII) to their sensitive conversational data, thus posing significant privacy risks. Unfortunately, existing private LLM solutions based on cryptography or trusted execution environments (TEEs) remain unpopular due to their prohibitive computational expense and platform restrictions. To enable practical user anonymity in LLM chatbots, we propose ProxyGPT, a privacy-enhancing system that leverages browser interaction proxies to submit user queries on their behalf. Unlike traditional proxy systems, ProxyGPT operates at the ""user"" layer by proxying user interactions with the browser in identity-required environments, thus easily supporting a wide range of chatbot services. We prevent malicious proxies by performing regular integrity audits using modern web proof protocols for TLS data provenance. We further utilize state-of-the-art LLM prompt guards on the proxy's side to mitigate unwanted user requests. Additionally, we incorporate a give-and-take economy based on Chaum's blind-signature e-cash to incentivize ProxyGPT users to proxy for others. Our system evaluation and user study demonstrate the practicality of our approach, as each chat request only takes a few additional seconds on average to fully complete. To the best of our knowledge, ProxyGPT is the first comprehensive proxy-based solution for privacy-preserving AI chatbots.","Submitted 11 June, 2025; v1 submitted 11 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

However, a growing concern is data contamination, where evaluation datasets may be contained in the pretraining corpus, inflating model performance. Decontamination, the process of detecting and removing such data, is a potential solution; yet these contaminants may originate from altered versions of the test set, evading detection during decontamination. How different types of contamination impact the performance of language models on downstream tasks is not fully understood. We present a taxonomy that categorizes the various types of contamination encountered by LLMs during the pretraining phase and identify which types pose the highest risk. We analyze the impact of contamination on two key NLP tasks -- summarization and question answering -- revealing how different types of contamination influence task performance during evaluation.","Submitted 11 July, 2024; originally announced July 2024."

This poses a challenge to LLMs' tool-use capabilities. However, there are evident gaps between existing tool-use evaluations and real-world scenarios. Current evaluations often use AI-generated queries, single-step tasks, dummy tools, and text-only interactions, failing to reveal the agents' real-world problem-solving abilities effectively. To address this, we propose GTA, a benchmark for General Tool Agents, featuring three main aspects: (i) Real user queries: human-written queries with simple real-world objectives but implicit tool-use, requiring the LLM to reason the suitable tools and plan the solution steps. (ii) Real deployed tools: an evaluation platform equipped with tools across perception, operation, logic, and creativity categories to evaluate the agents' actual task execution performance. (iii) Real multimodal inputs: authentic image files, such as spatial scenes, web page screenshots, tables, code snippets, and printed/handwritten materials, used as the query contexts to align with real-world scenarios closely. We design 229 real-world tasks and executable tool chains to evaluate mainstream LLMs. Our findings show that real-world user queries are challenging for existing LLMs, with GPT-4 completing less than 50% of the tasks and most LLMs achieving below 25%.

Furthermore, we explore alternatives to improve models' performance by augmenting the input context via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) relying on web search, and Self-Reflection using staged conversations that aim to re-collect relevant content from the model's internal memory. We find that MIXTRAL is highly accurate with an 82% accuracy on average with a significant performance disparity across different political groups (50-95%).
